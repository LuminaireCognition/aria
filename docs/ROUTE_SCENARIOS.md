In the universe of New Eden, a "short" route is rarely the "best" route. Depending on your ship, your cargo, and your security status, route planning is a constant tactical exercise.

Here are discrete route planning scenarios categorized by playstyle.

## High Security (Hi-Sec) Scenarios

### 1. The "Jita Haul" (Market Logistics)

* **Context:** Moving high-value items (implants, PLEX, blueprint originals) between trade hubs like Jita 4-4 and Amarr.
* **Routing Priority:** **Safety over Speed.** * **Planning:** Avoiding notorious gank pipes like **Uedama** or **Sivala**. A player might add multiple waypoints to take a longer, 0.6+ security route to minimize the window for suicide gankers to scan and strike.

### 2. Incursion "Staging" Relocation

* **Context:** Moving a multi-billion ISK battleship or Logistics cruiser to a new Incursion focus.
* **Routing Priority:** **CONCORD protection and Docking Access.**
* **Planning:** Ensuring the route doesn't pass through "islands" or low-sec pockets. Players often use the "Prefer Safer" setting and check "Avoid Systems" for any systems where they have low standings with the local faction navy.

### 3. Multi-Stop Asset Consolidation

* **Context:** An industrialist gathering planetary industry (PI) materials or minerals from 10 different stations to bring to a manufacturing hub.
* **Routing Priority:** **Efficiency (The Traveling Salesman Problem).**
* **Planning:** Using the in-game "Optimize" feature to rearrange 10+ waypoints into the shortest possible loop to save fuel and time.

## Low Security (Low-Sec) Scenarios

### 4. The Faction Warfare "Frontline" Push

* **Context:** A militia pilot traveling from a high-sec trade hub to a contested frontline system to join a fleet.
* **Routing Priority:** **Intel and Gate-Camp Avoidance.**
* **Planning:** Using external tools (like Dotlan) to check for "Kills in the last hour." The pilot plans a route that avoids "choke-point" gates where the opposing militia is known to camp with smartbombing battleships or sensor-boosted interceptors.

### 5. Piracy "Hunting" Roam

* **Context:** A small gang or solo pirate looking for targets.
* **Routing Priority:** **Target Density.**
* **Planning:** Instead of the shortest path, the pirate plans a "circular" route through high-traffic systems, asteroid belts, and moon mining beacons, intentionally avoiding high-sec gates where their "Criminal" status would trigger the Faction Police.

## Null Security (Null-Sec) Scenarios

### 6. The Jump Bridge Network (The "Blue Donut" Expressway)

* **Context:** An alliance member moving across their sovereign territory.
* **Routing Priority:** **Proprietary Infrastructure.**
* **Planning:** The in-game map often fails here; players use alliance-specific tools to plan routes that include **Ansiblex Jump Gates**. This turns a 40-jump trek into a 5-jump sprint, but requires planning around "jump fatigue" and fuel availability.

### 7. Black Ops "Cyno" Chain

* **Context:** A PVP hunter moving a stealth bomber or a Black Ops battleship to drop on a target.
* **Routing Priority:** **Invisibility and Jump Range.**
* **Planning:** This isn't gate-to-gate. The route is planned based on **Jump Drive range** (measured in Light Years). The player must coordinate "Cyno alts" at specific mid-points to "light the way," ensuring they stay out of range of enemy reconnaissance.

### 8. The ESS "Bank Robbery" Escape

* **Context:** A small gang has stolen millions from an Encounter Surveillance System (ESS) and is now being chased by a response fleet.
* **Routing Priority:** **Breaking Tackle.**
* **Planning:** The FC (Fleet Commander) must plan a route on the fly that leads to a "dead-end" system with a wormhole or a pre-planned "safe spot" to wait out aggression timers before using a **Filament** to teleport to a random location in the galaxy.

## Specialized & Advanced Scenarios

### 9. The "Thera" Shortcut

* **Context:** A traveler wanting to go from the northern regions (e.g., Deklein) to the south (e.g., Delve) without taking 60+ jumps.
* **Routing Priority:** **Unstable Connections.**
* **Planning:** Using the **EVE-Scout** website to find a wormhole entrance to the unique system **Thera**, then finding an exit hole near their destination. This requires "scanning down" the signatures on both ends.

### 10. Pochven "Border" Infiltration

* **Context:** Moving goods into or out of the Triglavian region, Pochven.
* **Routing Priority:** **Filament and Standing Mechanics.**
* **Planning:** Because standard gates are locked to those with low standings, players plan "in-routes" using **Entry Filaments** and "out-routes" using **Proximity Filaments** that drop them back into specific regions of Empire space.
