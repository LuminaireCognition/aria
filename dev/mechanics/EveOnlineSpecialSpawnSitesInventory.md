# **The Geopolitical and Geological Architecture of Special Spawn Sites in New Eden**

## **1\. Introduction: The Non-Uniform Distribution of Opportunity**

The cartography of New Eden is defined not merely by the static arrangement of stargates and constellations but by a complex, procedural overlay of resource distribution that defies uniform probability. While the majority of pilots operate under the assumption that resource availability scales linearly with security status—lower security equating to higher risk and reward—expert analysis reveals a far more nuanced "exception-based" topology. This report constitutes an exhaustive inventory and structural analysis of "special spawn sites," a category of cosmic anomalies and signatures that trigger only under highly specific conditions.

These sites, ranging from the geologically anomalous Empire Border Rare Asteroids (EBRAs) to the elusive NPC Capital Shipyards, represent the intersection of server-side conditional logic and player-driven economic geography. Unlike standard asteroid belts or combat anomalies, which populate based on regional indices, these special sites rely on "adjacency mechanics," "spectral dependencies," and "True Security" floating-point thresholds.

The following analysis dissects these phenomena, categorizing them by their trigger mechanisms—security status boundaries, stellar spectral classes, and regional sovereignty lore—to provide a comprehensive operational manual for the resource extraction and combat specialist.

## **2\. The Empire Border Rare Asteroid (EBRA) Phenomenon**

The user's query specifically identifies the "Empire Border Rare Asteroids" as a point of interest. These sites represent one of the most geographically distinct resource injections in the high-security ecosystem, effectively functioning as a "pressure valve" where low-security minerals bleed into high-security space through specific border connections.

### **2.1. The 0.5 Security Threshold and Adjacency Mechanics**

The primary existence condition for an EBRA is strict. The solar system must possess a rounded security status of exactly **0.5**. However, security status alone is insufficient. The system must ideally share a gate connection with a low-security (0.1–0.4) system, creating a "border" state utilized by the spawn algorithm.1

It is critical to distinguish these sites from standard asteroid belts. EBRAs are **Cosmic Anomalies**, appearing instantly in the onboard scanner or The Agency interface without the need for probe scanning. This classification dictates their respawn behavior. Unlike static belts, which typically replenish during the daily server downtime, EBRA anomalies operate on a "clearance-based" respawn timer. Evidence suggests that once an anomaly is fully mined out, the server attempts to respawn it elsewhere within the eligible pool of systems in the region or constellation.3 This mechanic creates a "whac-a-mole" dynamic where industrial fleets must actively hunt these spawns across multiple systems rather than camping a single location.

### **2.2. Mineral Composition and Economic Implications**

The economic significance of EBRAs cannot be overstated, particularly for the high-security industrialist. They introduce ores that are otherwise throttled by the security settings of Empire space. The composition of a typical EBRA spawn is highly regimented, containing specific counts of asteroids that yield minerals usually restricted to dangerous space.

The standard inventory of a 0.5 Security EBRA site is as follows:

| Ore Type | Count | Total Quantity (Units) | Total Volume (m³) | Strategic Value |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Ytirium** | 16 | 200,000 | 120,000 | Primary source of Isogen in High-Sec. |
| **Ducinium** | 1 | 2,073 | 33,168 | High-value Megacyte source. |
| **Eifyrium** | 1 | 2,073 | 33,168 | High-value Zydrine source. |
| **Jet Ochre** | 1 | 1,036 | 8,288 | Compact source of Nocxium and Isogen. |
| **Pellucid Crokite** | 1 | 1,036 | 16,576 | High-yield Nocxium, Zydrine, Megacyte. |
| **Sum Total** | **20** | **206,218** | **211,200** | **Comprehensive T1 Mineral Basket** |

Data aggregated from geological surveys of 0.5 systems.2

The **Ytirium** asteroids are the volumetric anchor of the site. With 16 asteroids totaling 120,000 m³, they provide a massive influx of Isogen, a mineral that frequently bottlenecks production in high-security space due to its scarcity in standard belts.4 The single spawns of **Ducinium** and **Eifyrium** function as "jackpot" nodes; their low asteroid count (1 each) means a single mining barge can extract the highest value-per-hour assets from the site in less than two cycles, often leaving the bulkier Ytirium for subsequent miners.2

### **2.3. Recent Mechanical Adjustments**

It is pertinent to note that the spawn mechanics for these sites have undergone revision. Historical data indicates that "Border Rare" sites could previously spawn multiple copies in the same system, leading to massive concentrations of wealth. However, recent patch notes (specifically the Catalyst expansion) implemented a restriction: Rare Border Sites in 0.5 systems can **no longer spawn multiple copies of the same site in the same solar system**.5 This forces a wider distribution of industrial activity and prevents single-system farming monopolies.

## **3\. Stellar Spectral Determinism: The Blue A0 Anomalies**

While the EBRA sites rely on system security status, a parallel and more lucrative set of anomalies relies on stellar physics. The "Blue A0" sites serve as the null-security and wormhole space equivalent of the border rare mechanic, tied explicitly to the spectral class of the local star.

### **3.1. The A0 Star Requirement**

These sites only manifest in systems orbiting a **Type A0** star, visually identified as a "Small Blue Star" in the game environment. This creates a "spectral determinism" where the physical characteristics of the star system override the regional resource tables.6

### **3.2. W-Space vs. Nullsec Variants**

The Blue A0 anomalies come in two distinct flavors depending on the topology of space they inhabit. Both serve to introduce "Border Ores"—variants of standard ores with modified reprocessing yields—into areas where they might not naturally occur.

#### **3.2.1. W-Space Blue A0 Rare Asteroids**

In wormhole space, where mineral independence is vital for long-term habitation, these sites provide minerals that are otherwise unavailable. The inventory differs significantly from the high-sec variants, introducing **Mordunium**.

| Ore Variant | Count | Quantity (Units) | Est. Volume (m³) | Wormhole Utility |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Mordunium** | 15 | 1,335,465 | High | Exclusive Pyerite/Mexallon source. |
| **Ducinium** | 2 | 13,554 | 216,864 | Zydrine/Megacyte. |
| **Eifyrium** | 2 | 8,012 | 128,192 | Zydrine source. |
| **Jet Ochre** | 2 | 5,342 | 42,736 | Nocxium/Isogen. |
| **Pellucid Crokite** | 2 | 5,342 | 85,472 | Nocxium/Zydrine. |
| **Ytirium** | 30 | 2,000,000 | High | Isogen bulk source. |

Data derived from Wormhole resource audits.6

The presence of **30 Ytirium** asteroids and **15 Mordunium** asteroids makes these sites significantly larger than their Empire counterparts, capable of sustaining industrial operations for small wormhole corporations.6

#### **3.2.2. Nullsec Blue A0 Rare Asteroids**

In Nullsec, the site serves a similar strategic role, mitigating regional mineral deficiencies. The Nullsec variant introduces "Moonshine" and "Imperial" prefixes, indicating higher mineral density.

| Ore Variant | Count | Quantity (Units) | Volume (m³) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Moonshine Ytirium** | 94 | 7,000,000 | 4,200,000 |
| **Plunder Mordunium** | 20 | 1,795,960 | 179,596 |
| **Imperial Ducinium** | 2 | 17,960 | 287,360 |
| **Augmented Eifyrium** | 2 | 10,776 | 172,416 |
| **Jet Ochre** | 2 | 7,184 | 57,472 |

Data derived from Nullsec survey logs.8

The massive volume of **Moonshine Ytirium** (4.2 million m³) makes these sites logistic challenges, requiring Rorqual support or compression capabilities to harvest efficiently. Like the 0.5 sites, these anomalies are now capped to prevent multiple spawns of the same site in a single system.5

## **4\. The Nebula Distribution: Gas Cloud Geopolitics**

Gas clouds, essential for the production of combat boosters (drugs) and advanced components, follow a rigid geographical logic that has historically shifted between constellation-based and region-based spawning. Current intelligence suggests a hybrid model where specific gas "flavors" are locked to specific regions and nebula types.

### **4.1. Mykoserocin: The Low-Sec and High-Sec Resource**

Mykoserocin gas is used primarily for "Synth" boosters and is the only gas type that spawns in High-Security space (albeit rarely) in addition to Low-Sec. Unlike the ubiquitous ore anomalies, gas spawns are tied to "Nebula" signatures found within specific regions.

The distribution map for Mykoserocin is as follows:

| Gas Flavor | Associated Nebula | Primary Regions |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Malachite / Mindflood** | Wild Nebula | Aridia, Insmother, Kor-Azor, Curse, Omist, Solitude, Tash-Murkon.9 |
| **Amber / Blue Pill** | Sunspark Nebula | Black Rise, Lonetrek, Outer Passage, Sinq Laison, The Citadel, The Forge, The Spire.9 |
| **Lime / Frentix** | Sister Nebula | Aridia, Curse, Derelik, Kador, Khanid, Omist, Solitude, Wicked Creek.9 |
| **Celadon / Exile** | Calabash Nebula | Domain, Genesis, Placid, Solitude, Fountain (Pegasus Constellation).9 |
| **Viridian / Drop** | Bright Nebula | Essence, Fountain, Placid, Tenal, Venal.9 |
| **Golden / X-Instinct** | *Historical* | *Historically linked to Lonetrek (Umamon)*.9 |

It is a common misconception that gas does not spawn in High-Sec. Scanners have confirmed Mykoserocin clouds in 1.0 security systems within regions like *Solitude* and *The Forge*, although the volume and frequency are significantly lower than in their Low-Sec counterparts.10 The spawn mechanic appears to be regional; depleting a site in one system triggers a respawn elsewhere in the region, maintaining a constant "pressure" of gas availability.11

### **4.2. Cytoserocin: The Null-Sec Combat Resource**

Cytoserocin is the high-value counterpart used for standard and strong boosters. It is almost exclusively a Null-Sec resource (with minor Low-Sec presence). Unlike the broad regional spread of Mykoserocin, Cytoserocin sites are often tethered to specific "hotspot" constellations within a region.

* **Hazard Mechanics:** A critical distinction of Cytoserocin sites is the environmental hazard. These clouds deal thermal damage to ships operating within them, necessitating hardened mining vessels or logistical support.12  
* **Spawn Logic:** Evidence suggests that while Cytoserocin is regional, specific constellations (e.g., *Serthoulde* in Placid for Viridian Cytoserocin) act as high-probability anchors, likely due to legacy code prioritizing these areas.13

## **5\. Security Status Gradients and Low-Sec Specialization**

The "special spawn" mechanic in Low-Security space (0.1 to 0.4) is defined by a granular gradient. The difference between a 0.2 and a 0.3 system is not merely numerical; it fundamentally alters the loot tables of the NPC entities that populate the belts.

### **5.1. The Clone Soldier Hierarchy**

Clone Soldiers are specialized NPCs that spawn in asteroid belts. They are sought after for their "Security Tags," which are the only consumable method for repairing negative security status. The spawn logic adheres to a strict inverse relationship with the system's rounded security status.

| Security Status | Clone Soldier Designation | Drop Item | Value Tier |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **0.4** | **Clone Soldier Trainer** | Trainer Tag | Lowest |
| **0.3** | **Clone Soldier Recruiter** | Recruiter Tag | Low |
| **0.2** | **Clone Soldier Transporter** | Transporter Tag | High (\~25M ISK) |
| **0.1** | **Clone Soldier Negotiator** | Negotiator Tag | Highest (\~30M+ ISK) |

Data verified via belt hunting logs.14

* **Spawn Frequency:** Clone Soldiers constitute approximately 10% of belt spawns.  
* **Farming Mechanic:** To force these spawns, hunters employ "belt chaining" or "clearing." By destroying all rats in a belt (or just the battleships/commanders), the system is forced to roll a new spawn after a set timer (approx. 20 minutes), which has a chance to be a Clone Soldier.16 The most valuable targets (Negotiators/Transporters) force pilots into the most dangerous "dead-end" systems of low-sec (0.1/0.2), where the risk of capital escalation is highest.18

### **5.2. Mordu’s Legion Special Warfare Units**

These units are the sole source of blueprints for the Garmur, Orthrus, and Barghest. They represent a "lottery" spawn in Low-Sec belts.

* **Adjacency to Clone Soldiers:** The spawn conditions for Mordu’s Legion units overlap significantly with Clone Soldiers. They are most frequently reported in **0.1 to 0.2** non-Faction Warfare Low-Sec systems, often replacing a standard belt rat spawn.19  
* **Combat Profile:** These are not standard rats; they are fast, agile, and use long-range points (Warp Scramblers). A "Special Warfare Unit" frigate can easily tackle and destroy an unprepared player frigate.  
* **Farming:** The most effective method involves the same "belt clearing" tactic used for Clone Soldiers. By wiping a belt of standard rats, the hunter rolls the dice for a Mordu spawn.20

### **5.3. Besieged Covert Research Facilities**

A unique class of site in Low-Sec is the **Besieged Covert Research Facility**. These appear as **Combat Anomalies** (green sites in the scanner) but function as high-difficulty loot pinatas.

* **Spawn Condition:** These sites spawn in all Low-Security regions. They are not gated, allowing any ship size to enter.22  
* **The Mordu’s Defense:** The site is guarded by Mordu’s Legion NPCs, including waves of battleships that can output up to **1000 DPS**. They prioritize Kinetic and Thermal damage and possess long-range webs and points (up to 100km), making kiting difficult.23  
* **Loot Table Analysis:**  
  * **Mordu’s BPCs:** Chance for hull blueprints.  
  * **Implants:** Low and Mid-Grade sets (Virtue, Nomad, etc.).  
  * **Faction Ammo:** Consistent drops of faction missiles/charges.  
  * **Skillbooks:** Drug-related skills (e.g., Neurotoxin Recovery).22  
* **Tactical Requirement:** Due to the high incoming DPS and EWAR, passive regeneration ships (like the Passive Gila) or Marauders are the preferred platforms. The site does not require a "hack" in the traditional sense; destroying the "Guristas Research and Trade Hub" structure drops the loot.22

## **6\. The True Security Floor: Deep Null and Officer Spawns**

In the deepest reaches of Null-Security space, the UI's rounded security status (e.g., \-1.0) hides the "True Security" (True Sec) value, a floating-point number that governs the rarest spawns in the game: Officers and Mercoxit.

### **6.1. The \-0.8 True Sec Threshold**

The "Holy Grail" of belt ratting is the Officer Spawn (e.g., Estamel Tharchon, Cormack Vaaja). These entities carry "Officer Modules" (purple quality) worth billions of ISK.

* **The Condition:** Officers only spawn in the **Home Regions** of their respective pirate factions and **only** in systems with a True Sec of **\-0.8** or lower (mathematically closer to \-1.0).24  
* **Faction Specificity:**  
  * **Angel Cartel:** *Curse, Fountain, Delve* (Historical overlap/conflict regions). Specific regions include *Stain* and *Curse*.25  
  * **Blood Raiders:** *Delve, Period Basis, Querious*.25  
  * **Guristas:** *Venal, Tenal, Tribute, Deklein*.25  
  * **Sansha’s Nation:** *Stain, Catch*.25  
  * **Drone Officers:** *Malpais, Perrigen Falls* (Spawning Unit P, Unit F, etc.).24

### **6.2. Mercoxit Availability**

Mercoxit is the highest-tier ore, required for Morphite production. Its natural existence is bound by the same True Sec logic as Officers.

* **Natural Spawns:** In standard asteroid belts, Mercoxit only appears if the system True Sec is **\-0.8** or lower.26  
* **Anomaly Override:** In Sovereign Null-Sec, players can bypass this restriction using Infrastructure Hub upgrades (Ore Prospecting Arrays) to force spawns of "Colossal" or "Enormous" asteroid clusters containing Mercoxit, regardless of the system's True Sec. However, in NPC Null-Sec (where upgrades are impossible), the \-0.8 rule remains the only way to find this ore.26

## **7\. Advanced Industrial Spawns: The NPC Shipyards**

The most complex "special spawn" mechanic currently in the game involves the **NPC Engineering Complexes** (Sotiyos). These are destructible structures that produce Pirate Capital ships.

### **7.1. The Hauler-Tracking Mechanic**

Unlike other sites, these Sotiyos **do not appear on any scanner**. They must be triangulated via a behavioral tracking mechanic involving NPC mining fleets.

1. **The Mining Fleet:** A "Diamond" mining fleet (e.g., Blood Raider) spawns in asteroid belts within the region.  
2. **The Hauler Spawn:** Once the miners fill their quota, a specialized NPC Hauler (Bestower/Impel for Blood Raiders, Badger/Bustard for Guristas) warps into the belt.  
3. **Tracking:** Players must scan the hauler and follow it. It will warp to a "Safe Spot" in deep space where the hidden Sotiyo is anchored.28

### **7.2. Regional Restrictions and Caps**

The server enforces a hard cap on the number of active Shipyards to maintain the rarity of the Titan blueprints they drop (Molok and Komodo).

* **Blood Raider Shipyards:** Historically concentrated in *Delve, Querious, Period Basis*, but recent patches have expanded the spawn footprint. NPC Sotiyos can now spawn anywhere within broader Null-Sec and Low-Sec regions where the faction has presence (including Aridia and Stain), though probability remains highest in traditional home regions. Cap: 1 in Null-Sec, 2 in Low-Sec.30
* **Guristas Shipyards:** Historically concentrated in *Venal, Tenal, Tribute*, but spawn footprint has similarly expanded to broader Null-Sec and Low-Sec faction presence zones. Cap: 2 in Null-Sec, 1 in Low-Sec.30

### **7.3. Defensive Spawn Breaking**

Advanced groups utilize a "breaking" mechanic to deny these sites to competitors. By destroying the NPC haulers repeatedly before they can return to the Sotiyo, the mining operation is disrupted. If both haulers associated with a spawn are destroyed, the mining fleet will not respawn a hauler until the next downtime, effectively "hiding" the Sotiyo from anyone attempting to scan it down for that 24-hour period.29

## **8\. Anomalous Zones: Pochven and Wormhole Space**

The rearrangement of the map into Pochven and the existence of "Shattered" wormholes created isolated pockets of special content.

### **8.1. Pochven Observatory Flashpoints**

These sites are the successors to the Invasion content.

* **Access:** Open cosmic anomalies—no key or gate required. Any pilot can warp directly to these sites regardless of Triglavian standings (though standings affect NPC behavior). Note: References to "Observatory Flashpoint Keys" in older invasion-era documentation do not apply to current persistent Pochven flashpoints.33
* **Economy:** They are the primary faucet for Triglavian Survey Databases and Zirnitra Dreadnought blueprints. The payout is essentially a massive ISK injection, making them highly contested by large fleets.32
* **Respawn:** Unlike the invasion era, these sites now have specific respawn timers to prevent infinite farming, a change implemented to balance the ISK faucet.34

### **8.2. World Ark Assault Flashpoints**

The apex of Pochven PvE is the World Ark Assault.

* **Availability:** Extremely rare and sporadic.  
* **Mechanics:** Requires an Incursion-scale fleet to survive the "Pozhlost Denial Zone" (system-wide damage). The site involves defeating the *Xordazh World Ark*.  
* **Rewards:** Massive payouts in loot and salvage, potentially exceeding 2-6 billion ISK per run, including Officer-tier modules (Zorya’s).35

### **8.3. Drifter Hives**

Drifter Hives are unique wormhole systems (e.g., J200727) accessible only via specific "Unidentified Wormhole" beacons found in systems with heavy Drifter activity.

* **The Connection:** These wormholes place the entering ship 80km off the destination wormhole, exposing them to Drifter Battleships.  
* **The Hive Site:** Inside, players can run the "Hive" combat site to obtain "Elements" and data required for advanced industry. This is the only source for specific Drifter-tech components.37

### **8.4. Shattered Wormhole Ice**

Shattered Wormholes (e.g., Thera or smaller shattered holes) have a unique "Ice" spawning mechanic.

* **The Spawn Mechanic:** Shattered wormholes (including Thera) share a global regional respawn timer for ice anomalies. Once a site is cleared, it can respawn in any other shattered hole in the cluster. Note: The persistent player myth of "trapped" spawns (claiming uncleared sites prevent respawns elsewhere) has no basis in official mechanics—the erratic availability is due to RNG distribution across the entire shattered ecosystem combined with high competition, creating a "boom or bust" experience for individual holes.39

## **9\. Transient and Legacy Phenomena**

Finally, certain spawns are dictated by weather or legacy code.

### **9.1. Metaliminal Storms**

These wandering weather effects move between systems in Null-Sec.

* **Spawn Amplification:** Systems under the influence of a "Strong" storm (e.g., Gamma, Plasma) see a marked increase in the spawn rate of Relic and Data sites. This makes "Storm Hunting" a viable exploration career, as the storm effectively carries a high-density pocket of sites with it as it travels.41

### **9.2. Chemical Labs (Gas Combat Sites)**

Often confused with harvesting sites, "Chemical Labs" (e.g., *Core Runner Exile Production Facility*) are combat sites that spawn in specific regions.

* **Regions:** *Cloud Ring, Fountain* (Serpentis); *Tenal, Vale* (Guristas); *Feythabolis* (Angel).  
* **Loot:** They are the source of drug blueprints and require a Data Analyzer.43

### **9.3. Great Wildlands Thukker Sites**

In the *Great Wildlands* and Thukker-associated space, the "Thukker Component Assembly Facility" spawns within combat sites.

* **Unique Loot:** This structure drops data chips for Thukker Capital Components, a niche but valuable market for capital ship optimization.44

## **10\. Conclusion**

The inventory of special spawn sites in EVE Online reveals a universe that is far from random. It is a structured, tiered ecosystem where specific conditions—**0.5 Security** for Isogen-rich EBRAs, **\-0.8 True Sec** for Officer modules, and **A0 Spectral Classes** for Wormhole minerals—dictate the flow of value. For the expert pilot, knowledge of these hidden logic gates is as valuable as the ship they fly. The map is not just a collection of stars, but a matrix of conditional probabilities waiting to be triggered.
