# **Strategic Resource Assessment: Regional Availability, Industrial Application, and Geopolitical Distribution of Select Mykoserocin and Cytoserocin Isotopes**

## **Executive Summary**

The contemporary industrial landscape of New Eden has undergone a radical transformation following the implementation of the "New Dawn" resource redistribution and the subsequent overhaul of capital ship manufacturing requirements. The harvesting of volatile interstellar gases—specifically the Mykoserocin and Cytoserocin families—has transitioned from a niche activity supporting the combat booster black market to a cornerstone of the cluster-wide military-industrial complex. This report provides an exhaustive analysis of four specific gas isotopes requested for review: **Azure Mykoserocin**, **Vermillion Mykoserocin**, **Chartreuse Cytoserocin**, and **Gamboge Cytoserocin**.

The core finding of this assessment is a fundamental bifurcation in the nature of these materials. **Azure Mykoserocin** and **Vermillion Mykoserocin** are naturally occurring, region-specific cosmic signatures integral to the production of Neurolink Enhancers and advanced combat boosters. Their availability is governed by astrophysical constraints, mapping primarily to specific constellations within Low Security and Null Security space, with rare spawns occurring in High Security (0.5+) systems within the Derelik and Heimatar regions.1 Conversely, **Chartreuse Cytoserocin** and **Gamboge Cytoserocin** act as procedural anomalies; they are mission-specific commodities generated exclusively within deadspace pockets assigned by Non-Player Character (NPC) agents.2 Consequently, while regional data for Azure and Vermillion is static and cartographically distinct, regional data for Chartreuse and Gamboge is functionally nonexistent in the context of natural resource extraction, as their presence is contingent upon agent interaction rather than stellar geography.

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for industrial directors, logistical strategists, and fleet commanders, detailing the precise spawn mechanics, regional footprints, industrial dependencies, and economic implications of these four distinct resources.

**1\. Introduction: The Gas Economy and Industrial Paradigm Shift**

To fully comprehend the availability data for the requested isotopes, one must first contextualize the mechanisms of gas cloud harvesting within the current economic epoch of the cluster. The distinction between "regional data" and "mission data" is not merely semantic but represents two entirely different gameplay loops with divergent economic consequences.

### **1.1 The Evolution of Gas Significance**

Historically, the harvesting of gas clouds was the domain of specialized booster manufacturers—chemists operating in the shadows of Empire space or deep within wormhole systems to produce performance-enhancing drugs. Mykoserocin gases were utilized for "Synth" boosters (legal, low-impact variations), while Cytoserocin gases were refined into "Standard," "Improved," and "Strong" variations, often carrying penalties for use.1

However, the industrial restructuring of the Capital Ship production paradigm fundamentally altered the demand profile for these resources. The introduction of **Neurolink Enhancers** as mandatory components for Capital and Supercapital hulls created a voracious industrial maw that consumes vast quantities of Mykoserocin gases.5 Specifically, **Azure Mykoserocin** and **Vermillion Mykoserocin** are now required to produce the molecular condensers and neurolink stabilizers that facilitate the neural interface between a capsuleer and a capital vessel.5 This shift has elevated these gases from optional commodities to strategic imperatives.

### **1.2 Defining the Availability Models**

The primary confusion regarding the availability of the four requested gases stems from their classification within the database and their spawn mechanics in the physical universe.

* **Cosmic Signature Availability (Azure & Vermillion):** These resources exist as persistent, region-specific phenomena. A capsuleer entering a system in the *Derelik* region, for example, may scan down a "Ghost Nebula." This site exists independently of any specific character's mission status. It is a shared resource, contestable by other players, and respawns according to regional distribution tables.1  
* **Procedural Mission Availability (Chartreuse & Gamboge):** These resources are temporary instances created when a player accepts a specific mission from a Mining or Distribution agent. The gas clouds exist only for the duration of the mission and are often objective-based tokens required to complete the agent's request. They do not spawn in natural cosmic signatures locatable by standard scanning probes in the open universe.2

## ---

**2\. Azure Mykoserocin: Regional Data and Strategic Analysis**

Azure Mykoserocin represents one of the most critical mid-tier industrial gases in the current market. It is a naturally occurring isotope found exclusively in specific concentrations within Low Security and, to a lesser extent, Null Security space. Its primary role is as a precursor for the *Sooth Sayer* line of combat boosters and the *Sense-Heuristic Neurolink Enhancer*.1

### **2.1 Astrophysical Association: The Ghost and Eagle Nebulae**

Identification of Azure Mykoserocin deposits requires familiarity with the specific cosmic signatures that house them. Unlike ore anomalies that appear on the overview, these sites must be located using scanning probes.

* **The Ghost Nebula:** This is the primary source of Azure Mykoserocin. It is a standard gas site located predominantly in Low Security space. The site typically contains two clouds of Azure Mykoserocin. Crucially, in its natural cosmic signature form, the Ghost Nebula is *not* guarded by NPC pirates 1, allowing for harvesting by covert ops frigates (such as the Prospect) or even uncloaked Ventures, provided the pilot can evade hostile players. The lack of NPC rats makes this a "pure" harvesting site, distinct from the combat-heavy gas sites found in wormhole space.  
* **The Eagle Nebula:** This site represents a richer, more voluminous source of Azure Mykoserocin. Like the Ghost Nebula, it is located in specific Low Security regions but is less common. The density of gas in an Eagle Nebula often attracts larger mining fleets, increasing the risk of detection by local predators.1

### **2.2 Regional Distribution Analysis (2025 Era)**

The distribution of Azure Mykoserocin is strictly tied to regional geography. The data indicates that Azure Mykoserocin is heavily concentrated in the "South-Eastern" quadrant of the cluster, specifically along the borders of the Amarr Empire and the Minmatar Republic.

#### **Primary Spawn Regions**

Based on the most current cartographic data 1, Azure Mykoserocin is confirmed to be available in the following regions:

1. **Curse:**  
   * *Security Status:* NPC Null Security.  
   * *Strategic Context:* Curse is home to the Angel Cartel. As an NPC null-sec region, it cannot be claimed by player alliances, meaning stations are open to all. This makes it a prime "staging ground" for independent gas harvesters. The presence of Azure Mykoserocin here links it to the chaotic geography of the "wild east." The region's connection to Empire space via the *Doril* system makes it a logistical chokepoint for gas exports.  
2. **Derelik:**
   * *Security Status:* Mixed (High/Low).
   * *Strategic Context:* A critical region bordering the Amarr Empire and Minmatar Republic. Derelik serves as a buffer zone. It is a high-traffic area for gas harvesters due to its proximity to the trade hub of *Rens* and the Amarr pipe. The constellation of *Joas* was historically significant for Lime Mykoserocin, but current data places Azure firmly within the region's spawn tables.1 Note: Azure Mykoserocin can spawn in high-security (0.5+) systems within Derelik at reduced frequency.  
3. **Devoid:**  
   * *Security Status:* Low Security.  
   * *Strategic Context:* Another Amarr-aligned Low Security region. Devoid is relatively quieter than the faction warfare zones, making it a preferred hunting ground for industrial corporations seeking Azure Mykoserocin with slightly lower risk profiles. The *Ghost Nebulae* here provide a steady supply of gas to the Amarr industrial machine.  
4. **The Bleak Lands:**  
   * *Security Status:* Low Security.  
   * *Strategic Context:* A notoriously dangerous region, heavily involved in Amarr-Minmatar Faction Warfare. Azure Mykoserocin spawns here are frequently located in systems that are actively contested by militia fleets. Harvesting here requires high situational awareness, as the region is constantly patrolled by combat frigates and cruisers.  
5. **Heimatar:**
   * *Security Status:* Mixed (High/Low).
   * *Strategic Context:* The heartland of the Minmatar Republic. While spawns are most frequent in the low-security pockets, Azure Mykoserocin can also appear in high-security (0.5+) systems within this region at reduced frequency.1 The "Hed" constellation is historically notable, though spawns are now distributed more broadly across both high and low-sec systems.
   * *Industrial Viability Warning:* High-sec spawns contain significantly lower volumes than Low-Sec counterparts and are subject to rapid depletion by local multi-boxers (often within minutes of spawning). Relying on 0.5 High-Sec spawns for Capital Ship production is not viable; treat these as supplementary income opportunities rather than a primary supply chain.  
6. **Molden Heath:**  
   * *Security Status:* Low Security.  
   * *Strategic Context:* A low-security Minmatar region adjacent to the Metropolis and Heimatar regions. Historically, this was one of the few locations where Azure Mykoserocin spawned prior to the 2014 redistribution.1 It remains a hotspot for this resource, often farmed by locals who control the few entry gates.

#### **Secondary and Theoretical Spawn Locations**

While the Amarr/Minmatar low-sec arc is the primary source, there are indications of "Azure \[note 1\]" varieties or mixed spawns in other regions.

* **Solitude & Placid:** Some databases suggest rare overlaps where Azure may appear alongside Viridian or Celadon gases, particularly in border constellations or specific event-driven shifts.1 However, industrial planning should not rely on these regions for Azure supply; they are primary sources for *Celadon* and *Viridian* gases. The primary reliable farming grounds remain the Derelik/Heimatar/Molden Heath axis.

#### **Career Agent Exception: Gas Training Sites**

A notable exception to the regional distribution rules exists in Career Agent systems. **Gas Training Sites** spawned as part of the Industry Career Agent mission chain contain Azure Mykoserocin regardless of the system's typical gas type. While the yield is low-volume, these sites provide unlimited respawns in High Security space, offering a safe (if inefficient) source for new pilots learning gas harvesting mechanics.

### **2.3 Industrial Application and Economic Velocity**

The demand profile for Azure Mykoserocin is driven by two distinct consumption channels, one legacy and one modern.

1. **Synth Sooth Sayer Booster Production:**  
   * Azure Mykoserocin is the raw material for the *Synth Sooth Sayer Booster Reaction*.8  
   * *Effect:* The Sooth Sayer booster improves the optimal range of turrets. This makes it a popular consumable for Gunnery-focused pilots, particularly those flying Amarr (Laser) and Minmatar (Projectile) ships where range control is paramount.  
   * *Market Velocity:* Moderate. Boosters are consumables, ensuring a steady baseline demand, but the "Synth" variety is the weakest version, limiting its price ceiling.  
2. **Capital Ship Construction (Neurolink Enhancers):**  
   * This is the high-volume industrial sink. The production of the *Sense-Heuristic Neurolink Enhancer* is a mandatory step in building Capital ships (Dreadnoughts, Carriers, Titans).  
   * *Reaction Requirement:* The *Sense-Heuristic Neurolink Enhancer* requires **10 units of Azure Cytoserocin** (a rarer variant) but the bulk volume comes from the **AV-Composite Molecular Condenser**, which requires **40 units of Azure Mykoserocin**.5  
   * *Reaction Chain:* Azure Mykoserocin \+ Vermillion Mykoserocin \+ Fuel Blocks $\\rightarrow$ AV-Composite Molecular Condenser.  
   * *Implication:* The fact that the Molecular Condenser requires *both* Azure and Vermillion Mykoserocin creates a symbiotic market relationship between these two gases. They are often found in similar or adjacent regions (e.g., Heimatar contains both), streamlining the logistics for local industrialists.

### **2.4 Geopolitical Insight: The "East/South" Bias**

The geographical data reveals a distinct "Eastern/Southern" bias in the distribution of Azure Mykoserocin. Industrialists based in the Caldari State (The Forge, Lonetrek) or Gallente Federation (Sinq Laison, Placid) are at a geographical disadvantage regarding this specific isotope. They must import Azure gas from the Minmatar/Amarr regions, creating a persistent logistics train from trade hubs like *Rens* and *Hek* toward *Jita*. This regional monopoly empowers local pirate entities in The Bleak Lands and Molden Heath who control the harvest grounds, allowing them to exert price pressure on the Jita market.

## ---

**3\. Vermillion Mykoserocin: Regional Data and Strategic Analysis**

Vermillion Mykoserocin acts as the industrial twin to Azure. It shares usage in the AV-Composite Molecular Condenser and serves as the base material for the *X-Instinct* booster line. Its distribution overlaps significantly with Azure but extends deeper into sovereign Null Security space.

### **3.1 Astrophysical Association: The Flame and Pipe Nebulae**

Vermillion Mykoserocin is harvested from nebulae distinct from those containing Azure, though they spawn in the same broad regions.

* **The Flame Nebula:** The most common source of Vermillion Mykoserocin. It is a Low Security signature. Like the Ghost Nebula, it is generally unguarded in its natural state, allowing for stealth harvesting.1  
* **The Pipe Nebula:** A secondary source, found in Low Security and select Null Security pockets. The yield in Pipe Nebulae can be substantial. The name refers to the visual configuration of the cloud, which often requires pilots to navigate carefully to reach the extraction point.1

### **3.2 Regional Distribution Analysis (2025 Era)**

The data confirms that Vermillion Mykoserocin shares the Amarr/Minmatar footprint of Azure but has a significantly larger presence in deep Null Security.

#### **Primary Spawn Regions**

1. **Heimatar:**
   * *Security Status:* Mixed (High/Low).
   * *Strategic Context:* Arguably the most critical region for Vermillion gas. The *Hed* constellation in Heimatar was historically the exclusive source 1, and it remains a high-density spawn area. This historical legacy means many older guides still point players exclusively to Hed, leading to over-competition in that specific constellation. Note: Vermillion Mykoserocin can also spawn in high-security (0.5+) systems within Heimatar at reduced frequency.  
2. **Curse:**  
   * *Security Status:* NPC Null Security.  
   * *Strategic Context:* Shared with Azure Mykoserocin. The Angel Cartel's home region provides a dual-source environment, allowing deep-space transports to fill holds with both Azure and Vermillion isotopes, maximizing the value of a blockade-running trip.  
3. **Derelik & Devoid:**  
   * *Security Status:* Low Security.  
   * *Strategic Context:* These regions mirror the Azure distribution. The presence of both gases here cements the Amarr/Minmatar border zone as the primary export hub for the *AV-Composite* line of materials.  
4. **Great Wildlands:**  
   * *Security Status:* NPC Null Security.  
   * *Strategic Context:* This is a key differentiator from Azure. The Great Wildlands is a vast, empty region of NPC null-sec inhabited by Thukker Tribe NPCs. It provides a non-sovereignty environment for harvesting Vermillion Mykoserocin. It is often utilized by itinerant nomad corporations who do not wish to pay rent to large alliances or deal with the politics of Sovereign Null Sec.  
5. **Insmother:**  
   * *Security Status:* Sovereign Null Security.  
   * *Strategic Context:* Located in the "Drone Regions" / East. This places Vermillion Mykoserocin within the grasp of the major null-sec alliances holding territory in the East. Sovereignty holders here can mine Vermillion in relative safety under their own capital umbrellas.  
6. **Omist & Tenerifis:**  
   * *Security Status:* Sovereign Null Security.  
   * *Strategic Context:* Deep Null Security regions in the South/East. These spawns allow the major power blocs in the south (historically alliances like TEST or Goonswarm, depending on the era's map) to access domestic supplies of Vermillion without relying entirely on Empire space imports.1  
7. **Metropolis:**  
   * *Security Status:* Mixed (High/Low).  
   * *Strategic Context:* While largely High Security, its Low Security pockets (and the connection to the Wildlands) host Vermillion spawns.

### **3.3 Industrial Application and Market Dynamics**

Vermillion Mykoserocin drives the production of the *X-Instinct* booster, which reduces signature radius—a critical attribute for speed-tanking ships and blockade runners.

1. **Synth X-Instinct Booster Production:**  
   * Produced directly from Vermillion Mykoserocin via the *Synth X-Instinct Booster Reaction*.8  
   * *Effect:* Reduces the signature radius of the pilot's ship. This makes the ship harder to lock and harder to hit with turret weapons (tracking disruption) and missiles (explosion radius). It is a vital drug for interceptor pilots and heavy interdictors relying on speed tanking.  
2. **Capital Ship Construction (Neurolink Enhancers):**  
   * As noted in section 2.3, the **AV-Composite Molecular Condenser** reaction consumes 40 units of Vermillion Mykoserocin alongside Azure.  
   * *Market Implication:* Because Vermillion spawns in deep Null Sec (Insmother, Omist) as well as Low Sec, the supply is generally more elastic than Azure, which is more constrained to the Low Sec belts. However, the consumption rate is identical, often leading to Azure becoming the price bottleneck in the AV-Composite pairing.

### **3.4 Strategic Insight: The Null-Sec Advantage**

Unlike Azure Mykoserocin, which is heavily weighted toward Low Security Empire space (Derelik, Molden Heath), Vermillion Mykoserocin has a broader footprint in deep Null Security. This gives Null Sec alliances a slight advantage in self-sufficiency for Vermillion. A Null Sec alliance in *Insmother* can harvest its own Vermillion but must import Azure, creating a trade deficit that flows ISK back toward the Low Sec dwellers of the Amarr/Minmatar warzone.

**4\. The Cytoserocin Anomaly: Chartreuse and Gamboge**

This section addresses the latter two gases in the user's inquiry: **Chartreuse Cytoserocin** and **Gamboge Cytoserocin**. It is imperative to distinguish these from the standard "industrial" Cytoserocins (e.g., Golden, Viridian, Celadon) that spawn in high-value nebulae.

**Research Findings:** Unlike Azure and Vermillion Mykoserocin, Chartreuse and Gamboge Cytoserocin **do not possess regional spawn data** in the context of the open universe. They are **Mission Items** spawned only within specific agent-offered scenarios.

### **4.1 Chartreuse Cytoserocin: The Drone Lure**

* **Classification:** Mission Objective / Trade Good.  
* **Associated Mission:** *Like Drones to a Cloud*.2  
* **Mechanics:** This gas appears in a specific deadspace pocket generated when a player accepts the mission "Like Drones to a Cloud."  
  * *Scenario:* The mission briefing describes rogue drones being attracted to a "Chartreuse Cytoserocin cloud" in a specific system. The player's objective is to harvest the cloud to remove the lure for the drones.3  
  * *Spawn Location:* The system where the mission agent is located (or an adjacent system designated by the agent). It is not a cosmic signature. A player cannot scan this down in a system unless they or another player has triggered the mission.  
  * *Threat Profile:* The mission pocket spawns Rogue Drones at 5-minute intervals. These are "wild drones" with specific resistances. A specialized Venture or a cruiser with gas harvesters is required to tank the damage while harvesting the gas.  
* **Industrial Use:** There are **no known blueprints** or reactions that utilize Chartreuse Cytoserocin for the mass production of boosters or capital components.4 It functions primarily as a "key" to complete the mission or as a vendor trash item. Market listings for this item 9 reflect trade in the mission token itself, often by players who mined more than necessary or failed to turn it in.

### **4.2 Gamboge Cytoserocin: The Medical MacGuffin**

* **Classification:** Mission Objective / Trade Good.  
* **Associated Mission:** *Gas Injections* (Level 4 Mining Mission).4  
* **Mechanics:** The agent requests the player to mine a specific quantity (425 units / 4250 m³) of Gamboge Cytoserocin to manufacture "pain medications" for wounded soldiers.4  
  * *Spawn Location:* Like Chartreuse, this spawns only within the mission's deadspace pocket. It is not found in the *Snake*, *Owl*, or other standard Cytoserocin nebulae.  
  * *Mission Environment:* The mission pocket typically contains one cloud of Gamboge Cytoserocin. It may or may not contain hostile NPCs depending on the specific variation of the mission and the faction of the agent.  
* **Industrial Use:** Zero standard industrial application. It is exclusively a mission objective token. The "medicinal drugs" mentioned in the mission text are flavor lore, not a craftable in-game item derived from this specific gas.4

### **4.3 Why "Regional Data" is Unavailable**

If a user searches for "Gamboge Cytoserocin region," the search will yield no results in standard resource maps (like Dotlan or the Agency) because the resource is **procedurally generated**.

* If a Mining Agent in the *Lonetrek* region gives the mission "Gas Injections," Gamboge Cytoserocin exists in *Lonetrek* for that specific player for the duration of the mission.  
* If a Mining Agent in Domain gives the same mission, the gas exists in Domain.  
  Therefore, the availability of Chartreuse and Gamboge Cytoserocin is a function of Mining Agent Distribution, not Astrophysical Gas Distribution.

### **4.4 The Danger of Market Confusion**

Novice industrialists often purchase Chartreuse or Gamboge Cytoserocin on the market, mistaking them for the valuable *Golden* or *Vermillion* Cytoserocins needed for "Strong" boosters. This is a common market pitfall. The data confirms that Chartreuse and Gamboge have no slots in the *Biochemical Reactor* schematics.5 They are "dead-end" items in the manufacturing tree.

**5\. Comparative Analysis of the Four Gas Types**

The following table summarizes the critical distinctions between the requested gas types, consolidating the data regarding their availability and utility.

### **Table 1: Classification and Availability Matrix**

| Gas Name | Classification | Primary Nebula | Regional Availability (2025) | Industrial Utility |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Azure Mykoserocin** | Cosmic Signature Resource | Ghost Nebula, Eagle Nebula | **Highsec (rare):** Derelik, Heimatar. **Lowsec:** Derelik, Devoid, Bleak Lands, Heimatar, Molden Heath. **Nullsec:** Curse. | **High:** Synth Sooth Sayer, Sense-Heuristic Neurolink Enhancers (Capital Ships). |
| **Vermillion Mykoserocin** | Cosmic Signature Resource | Flame Nebula, Pipe Nebula | **Highsec (rare):** Heimatar. **Lowsec:** Heimatar, Derelik, Devoid. **Nullsec:** Curse, Great Wildlands, Insmother, Omist, Tenerifis. | **High:** Synth X-Instinct, Sense-Heuristic Neurolink Enhancers (Capital Ships). |
| **Chartreuse Cytoserocin** | Mission Commodity | Mission Pocket (*Like Drones to a Cloud*) | **Procedural:** Spawns anywhere a Mining/Distribution Agent generates the mission. | **None:** Mission completion token only. No manufacturing use. |
| **Gamboge Cytoserocin** | Mission Commodity | Mission Pocket (*Gas Injections*) | **Procedural:** Spawns anywhere a Mining Agent generates the mission. | **None:** Mission completion token only. No manufacturing use. |

**6\. Industrial Integration: The Capital Ship Bottleneck**

To provide context for the regional importance of Azure and Vermillion Mykoserocin, it is necessary to examine the industrial chain they support. The "New Dawn" update introduced a complexity layer to capital production intended to distribute wealth across different regions of space.

### **6.1 The Neurolink Enhancer Tree**

Capital ships now require *Neurolink Protection Cells*. These cells are assembled from varying types of *Neurolink Enhancers*.

* **Sense-Heuristic Neurolink Enhancer:** Requires **AV-Composite Molecular Condenser**.  
* **AV-Composite Molecular Condenser:** Requires **40 Azure Mykoserocin** \+ **40 Vermillion Mykoserocin**.

This formula dictates that for every capital ship built, thousands of units of Azure and Vermillion gas must be harvested.

* *Regional Dependency:* A shipyard in the North (Caldari/Gallente space) cannot locally source these gases. They must import them from the South-East (Amarr/Minmatar).  
* *Volume:* The volume of gas required is substantial. A single reaction run consumes 40 units of each. A capital ship might require hundreds of Enhancers. This creates a high-volume logistics lane from *Rens* to *Jita*.

### **6.2 The Cytoserocin Trap**

It is crucial to note that while **Chartreuse** and **Gamboge** Cytoserocins share the "Cytoserocin" name, they **cannot** be used in place of the industrial Cytoserocins (like Azure Cytoserocin or Vermillion Cytoserocin) required for the *Sense-Heuristic Neurolink Enhancer*.

* *Azure Cytoserocin:* A valuable gas found in the *Rapture Nebula* (Cosmic Signature). Used in industry.  
* Chartreuse Cytoserocin: A mission item. Not used in industry.  
  The naming convention is a legacy artifact that often confuses newer players, leading to the purchase of useless mission gas on the market.

## ---

**7\. Geopolitical and Strategic Implications**

The distribution of Azure and Vermillion Mykoserocin has distinct second-order effects on the political geography of New Eden.

### **7.1 The "Amarr-Minmatar" Industrial Corridor**

The concentration of both Azure and Vermillion Mykoserocin in the **Derelik**, **Heimatar**, and **Molden Heath** regions creates a specific industrial gravity.

* *Logistical Choke Points:* Industrialists manufacturing Capital Ships require vast amounts of these gases. This necessitates a robust logistics chain moving gas from the dangerous low-security systems of Heimatar into the high-security production facilities of the Amarr Empire or the Citadel.  
* *Conflict Drivers:* The restriction of these gases to Low Security space ensures that they are permanent drivers of conflict. Unlike asteroid mining which can be done in relative safety in High Sec (albeit at lower yields), the Azure/Vermillion supply chain forces industrial players to expose assets to PvP risk. This makes the *Derelik* and *Heimatar* regions perennially active with hunters looking for gas harvesters (Prospects/Ventures).

### **7.2 The "New Dawn" Scarcity Paradigm**

The 2021 industrial update (referenced as "New Dawn" or the scarcity/redistribution era) 6 locked the production of Capital Ships behind components made from these specific gases.

* *Price Volatility:* Prior to this change, Mykoserocin was a low-value commodity. Post-change, the value of Azure and Vermillion Mykoserocin skyrocketed.  
* *Regional Wealth:* Regions like **Placid** and **Solitude** (which have Viridian/Celadon gases) compete with the **Heimatar/Derelik** block (Azure/Vermillion). However, since Capital production requires *all* types of Neurolink Enhancers (which in turn require different gases), inter-regional trade is mandatory. No single region is self-sufficient for Capital production. This enforces a level of economic interdependence between the four empires.

**8\. Detailed Regional Data Tables**

To facilitate precise navigation for resource harvesting, the following tables break down the specific regional associations for the two harvestable gases.

### **Table 2: Azure Mykoserocin Distribution**

| Region | Security Status | Primary Nebula | Strategic Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Derelik** | High/Low Sec | Ghost Nebula | High traffic; close proximity to Amarr trade hub. Rare high-sec (0.5+) spawns confirmed. |
| **Heimatar** | High/Low Sec | Ghost / Eagle | High density of spawns; heavily camped by local pirate entities. Rare high-sec (0.5+) spawns confirmed. |
| **Molden Heath** | Low Sec | Ghost Nebula | Historical primary source; arguably the most reliable region for this gas type. |
| **Curse** | Null Sec (NPC) | Ghost / Eagle | Dangerous entry; allows for harvesting by non-sovereign entities. |
| **The Bleak Lands** | Low Sec | Ghost Nebula | Active Faction Warfare zone; high risk of combat during harvesting. |
| **Devoid** | Low Sec | Ghost Nebula | Lower traffic than Heimatar, potentially safer for ninja-harvesting. |

### **Table 3: Vermillion Mykoserocin Distribution**

| Region | Security Status | Primary Nebula | Strategic Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Heimatar** | High/Low Sec | Flame / Pipe | Overlaps with Azure; the "Hed" constellation is a historical hotspot. Rare high-sec (0.5+) spawns confirmed. |
| **Great Wildlands** | Null Sec (NPC) | Flame Nebula | Excellent for Thukker-aligned nomads; no sovereign claim required. |
| **Insmother** | Null Sec (Sov) | Flame Nebula | Controlled by major null-sec power blocs; limited access for neutrals. |
| **Tenerifis** | Null Sec (Sov) | Flame Nebula | Deep south; logistical difficulty in exporting to high-sec markets. |
| **Metropolis** | Low/High | Flame Nebula | Spawns restricted to the Low Security pockets of the region. |
| **Curse** | Null Sec (NPC) | Flame Nebula | Dual spawn region (Vermillion \+ Azure); high value target for gas harvesters. |

**9\. Conclusion**

The inquiry regarding the regional data of Azure Mykoserocin, Vermillion Mykoserocin, Chartreuse Cytoserocin, and Gamboge Cytoserocin reveals a fundamental dichotomy in the material taxonomy of New Eden.

**Azure and Vermillion Mykoserocin** are critical strategic resources. They are region-locked to the Eastern and Southern corridors of the cluster (Heimatar, Derelik, Curse, Insmother) and are essential for the synthesis of Sooth Sayer/X-Instinct boosters and the construction of Capital Ships via Sense-Heuristic Neurolink Enhancers. Their regional data is static, mapping primarily to Low Security and Null Security space, with confirmed rare spawns in High Security (0.5+) systems within Derelik and Heimatar regions.

**Chartreuse and Gamboge Cytoserocin** are procedural artifacts. They act as narrative devices within the mission system ("Like Drones to a Cloud" and "Gas Injections") and possess no persistent regional footprint or industrial utility beyond their specific quest turn-ins.

For the industrialist or fleet commander, the actionable intelligence is clear: Establish harvesting or trade routes into **Heimatar and Derelik** to secure supplies of Azure and Vermillion Mykoserocin, while strictly filtering Chartreuse and Gamboge Cytoserocin from all acquisition lists to avoid contamination of the supply chain with useless mission debris. The economic reliance on the Amarr/Minmatar low-security border zone for these capital ship components ensures that these regions will remain geopolitical flashpoints for the foreseeable future.
