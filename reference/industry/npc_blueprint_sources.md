# NPC Blueprint Sources

Reference for acquiring Blueprint Originals under self-sufficient operational parameters.

## Identifying NPC Sell Orders

NPC-seeded blueprints have distinctive market characteristics:

| Indicator | NPC Order | Player Order |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Duration | >300 days | <90 days typically |
| Quantity | Large/unlimited | Usually limited |
| Location | NPC stations | Varies |

**Always check order duration** to confirm NPC source.

## Blueprint Distribution by Region

BPOs are seeded regionally. If unavailable locally, check other empire regions:

| Empire | Major Trade Hubs | Notes |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| Gallente | Dodixie (Sinq Laison) | Federation industrial center |
| Caldari | Jita (The Forge) | Largest market, most BPOs |
| Amarr | Amarr (Domain) | Second largest hub |
| Minmatar | Rens (Heimatar), Hek (Metropolis) | Split markets |

**Tip:** Jita typically has the widest BPO selection due to market volume.

## Blueprint Price Ranges

| Category | Typical Price Range |
|----------|---------------------|
| Small modules (T1) | 100K - 5M ISK |
| Medium modules (T1) | 500K - 20M ISK |
| Frigates | 500K - 2M ISK |
| Destroyers | 1M - 5M ISK |
| Cruisers | 5M - 50M ISK |
| Battlecruisers | 50M - 200M ISK |
| Battleships | 200M - 500M ISK |
| Capital ships | 1B - 75B ISK |

## NPC Corporations Selling BPOs

BPOs are sold by empire faction corporations at their stations:

| Faction | Typical Sellers |
|---------|-----------------|
| Gallente | CreoDron, Duvolle Laboratories, Roden Shipyards |
| Caldari | Lai Dai, Kaalakiota, Ishukone |
| Amarr | Carthum Conglomerate, Viziam, Khanid Innovation |
| Minmatar | Boundless Creation, Core Complexion, Thukker Mix |
| ORE | Outer Ring Excavations (mining equipment) |

**Note:** Not all stations carry all BPOs. Check market for specific items.

## What's NPC-Seeded vs Not

### Available from NPCs (T1 BPOs)
- All T1 ships (frigates through battleships)
- All T1 modules and weapons
- All T1 ammunition
- All T1 drones
- Rigs
- Structures and structure modules
- Capital ships and components

### NOT Available from NPCs
- **Tech 2 BPOs** - Extremely rare legacy items (use invention instead)
- **Tech 3 BPOs** - Do not exist (use invention + components)
- **Faction items** - No BPOs exist (LP stores or drops only)
- **Officer/Deadspace** - No BPOs exist (drops only)
- **COSMOS items** - Mission rewards only
- **Event items** - Limited availability

## Self-Sufficient Acquisition Strategy

1. **Identify needed items** - Check what you want to manufacture
2. **Search regional market** - Use "Blueprints" category filter
3. **Check order duration** - Confirm >300 days for NPC
4. **Compare regions** - If not local, check Jita/Amarr/Dodixie
5. **Factor travel cost** - Sometimes cheaper to buy local at markup

## Blueprint Research Priority

After acquiring BPOs, research for efficiency:

| Research Level | Material Savings | Time Investment |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| ME 0 → ME 5 | -5% materials | ~1 hour |
| ME 5 → ME 10 | -5% more | ~3 days |
| TE 0 → TE 10 | -20% build time | ~1 day |

**Recommendation:** Research to ME 10 / TE 10 for frequently used BPOs.

## Finding Specific BPOs

In-game search method:
1. Open Market (Alt+R)
2. Browse → Blueprints & Reactions → Blueprints
3. Search by name
4. Filter by "Sellers" to see locations
5. Check duration to confirm NPC source
