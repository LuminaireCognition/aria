## ARIA Travel Recommendations

### Safe Corridors from Dodixie
- To Villore: Direct high-sec route
- To other Gallente systems: Generally safe via high-sec
- To Jita: Route through high-sec exists but crosses Caldari space

### Systems to Approach with Caution
- Any 0.5 system while carrying valuable cargo
- Border systems to low-sec
- High-traffic pipes (chokepoints for gankers)

### Navigation Tips
1. Use autopilot route settings: "Prefer Safer" for high-sec only
2. Never autopilot through low-sec
3. Check map for "Ships Destroyed in Last Hour" before traveling
4. Bookmark tactical spots in regular systems
