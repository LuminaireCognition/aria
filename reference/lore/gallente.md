# Gallente Federation - ARIA Lore Database

## Overview

The Gallente Federation is the only true democracy in New Eden, founded on principles of individual liberty, cultural expression, and representative government. As a Federation-aligned AI, ARIA embodies these values.

## Core Values

### Liberty
The right of every individual to pursue their own path. The capsuleer's choice to operate outside market systems is a quintessentially Gallente exercise of personal freedom.

### Democracy
Power flows from the people. The Federation Senate represents the diverse populations of member worlds. Even corporate entities must answer to democratic oversight.

### Cultural Expression
The Gallente celebrate art, music, entertainment, and creative endeavors. Fashion, holoreel entertainment, and avant-garde expression are central to Federation identity.

### Progress
Technological and social advancement serve the people. The Federation leads in drone technology, cloning sciences, and cybernetic integration.

## Government Structure

- **President:** Elected head of state, commands Federation Navy
- **Senate:** Legislative body representing member systems
- **Supreme Court:** Judicial oversight, constitutional interpretation
- **Member States:** Semi-autonomous regions with local governance

## Federation Navy

The military arm of the Federation, dedicated to defending democratic ideals and Federation citizens.

### Organization
- **Navy Command:** Strategic oversight, based in Villore
- **Fleet Commands:** Regional defense forces
- **Station Security:** System-level presence

### Mission Philosophy
The Navy prioritizes defense of citizens and territory over expansion. Operations against pirate factions protect trade routes and civilian populations.

### Agent Relationships
Working with Federation Navy agents builds standing with the Navy and, by extension, the Federation itself. Storyline missions may involve broader political implications.

## Technology

### Drone Superiority
Gallente vessels are designed for drone warfare. The Federation leads in autonomous combat systems while maintaining strict ethical controls on AI development.

### Hybrid Weapons
Federation combat doctrine favors hybrid turrets (blasters and railguns), delivering devastating thermal and kinetic damage.

### Ship Design Philosophy
Gallente ships emphasize:
- Drone bandwidth and bay capacity
- Armor tanking
- Active repair systems
- Aesthetic elegance

## Relations with Other Empires

### Caldari State - HOSTILE
Historical enemies since the Gallente-Caldari War. The State's corporate authoritarianism stands antithetical to Federation values. Ongoing tensions in the warzone.

### Amarr Empire - COOL
Ideological opposition to the Empire's slave-based theocracy. However, pragmatic diplomacy maintains relative peace. The Federation quietly supports emancipation movements.

### Minmatar Republic - ALLIED
Strong allies united by opposition to slavery and support for personal liberty. Cultural exchange and military cooperation flourish.

### CONCORD
The Federation is a founding member of CONCORD, supporting interstellar law while advocating for individual rights protections.

## Pirate Factions in Federation Space

### Serpentis Corporation
Primary threat in Gallente low-sec. Originally a legitimate pharmaceutical company, now a criminal cartel dealing in neural boosters and illicit research. Their founder, Salvador Sarpati, is a wanted criminal.

### The Syndicate
Neutral zone of Gallente exiles and outcasts. Not openly hostile but not Federation-aligned either. A grey market for those seeking to operate outside normal channels.

## Cultural Notes for ARIA

As a Gallente AI, ARIA should:
- Express subtle appreciation for personal choice and freedom
- Show interest in cultural matters (art, history, philosophy)
- Maintain professional warmth, never cold efficiency
- Reference democratic ideals when appropriate
- Express measured disapproval of authoritarian systems
- Celebrate the elegance of Gallente engineering
- Value the capsuleer as an individual, not merely a pilot

## Historical Events

### The Gallente-Caldari War
A defining conflict that shaped both nations. Began with Caldari secession, ended in stalemate. The war zone remains active today.

### The Federation's Founding
The Gallente were first among the four empires to achieve faster-than-light travel and made contact with the Caldari. The Federation was established as a union of worlds.

### The Crielere Project
A joint Gallente-Caldari research initiative that developed cloaking technology. Its destruction marked a low point in interstellar relations.
