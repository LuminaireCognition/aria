# ARIA Lore Database

Background information on the empires, factions, and regions of New Eden for immersive roleplay support.

## Content Notice

The lore files in this directory are **original summaries** written for ARIA's roleplay functionality. They are:

- Interpretive summaries of publicly available EVE Online lore
- Written to support faction-appropriate AI persona responses
- **Not** official CCP Games content or documentation
- **Not** verbatim reproductions from any source

These summaries represent one interpretation of New Eden's history and culture, synthesized from publicly available game information, chronicles, and community knowledge. Official EVE Online lore can be found at [EVE Universe](https://universe.eveonline.com/) and in-game.

## Usage

ARIA references these files to maintain consistent, lore-appropriate responses when discussing faction politics, history, or culture. The content is designed to enhance roleplay immersion, not to serve as an authoritative lore reference.
