# Breakpoint skills - Level V unlocks non-linear gameplay effects beyond percentages
# These override the "cap at IV" rule when the detected role applies.
# Unlike multiplier skills (percentage bonuses), breakpoint skills unlock
# discrete capabilities at specific levels.

# Categories:
#   - combat: Combat role breakpoints (drone_boat, turret_boat, etc.)
#   - tank: Tank-related breakpoints (armor_tank, active_tank)
#   - stealth: Cloaking and covert operations
#   - industrial: Mining, gas, ice harvesting
#   - capital: Jump drives, cynos
#   - universal: Applies to all combat roles

    - turret_boat
    - missile_boat
  category: "combat"
  reason: "CPU reduction often required to fit T2 weapons + damage mods together"
