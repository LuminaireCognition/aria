# Caldari Ship Progression

Training roadmap for Caldari pilots. Includes mining (ORE) and exploration paths.

## Caldari Combat Philosophy

- **Primary Tank:** Shields
- **Primary Weapons:** Missiles (all ranges), Hybrid turrets (railguns/blasters)
- **EWAR Specialty:** ECM (Electronic Counter Measures)
- **Damage Types:** Kinetic/Thermal (hybrids), Selectable (missiles)

## Combat Ship Progression

### Frigates → Destroyers → Cruisers

```
Kestrel (Missile Frig) ────┐
                           ├──→ Corax (Missile Dessie) ──→ Caracal (Missile Cruiser)
Condor (Tackle Frig) ──────┘                                │
                                                            ├──→ Caracal Navy Issue
                                                            └──→ Cerberus (T2 HAC)

Merlin (Hybrid Frig) ──────┐
                           ├──→ Cormorant (Rail Dessie) ──→ Moa (Hybrid Cruiser)
                           │                                │
                           │                                └──→ Eagle (T2 HAC)
```

### Primary Combat Lines

#### Missile Line (Recommended for New Players)

| Ship | Class | Role | Key Stats |
|------|-------|------|-----------|
| **Kestrel** | Frigate | Missile boat | 4 launchers, good tank |
| **Corax** | Destroyer | Missile destroyer | 7 launchers, high alpha |
| **Caracal** | Cruiser | Rapid lights/HAMs | 5 launchers, excellent range |
| **Caracal Navy Issue** | Faction Cruiser | Enhanced Caracal | Better tank and DPS |
| **Cerberus** | HAC (T2) | Heavy missiles | Extreme range, high DPS |

**Why missiles for new players:** Selectable damage types let you exploit any NPC weakness. No tracking concerns - if you can lock it, you can hit it.

#### Hybrid Line

| Ship | Class | Role | Key Stats |
|------|-------|------|-----------|
| **Merlin** | Frigate | Blaster brawler | Tough little ship |
| **Cormorant** | Destroyer | Railgun sniper | Long range, glass cannon |
| **Moa** | Cruiser | Shield hybrid | Good tank, moderate DPS |
| **Eagle** | HAC (T2) | Rail sniper | Extreme range platform |

### Battlecruiser → Battleship

| Ship | Class | Role | Notes |
|------|-------|------|-------|
| **Drake** | Battlecruiser | Heavy missiles | Legendary tank, passive shield |
| **Ferox** | Battlecruiser | Railguns | Fleet sniper platform |
| **Raven** | Battleship | Cruise/Torpedo | Classic L4 mission runner |
| **Rokh** | Battleship | Railguns | Extreme range BS |

### The Drake - New Player's Best Friend

The Drake deserves special mention. Its passive shield tank is:
- Capacitor independent (no cap = still tanking)
- Forgiving of mistakes
- Excellent for learning mission mechanics

Many Caldari pilots consider the Drake their first "real" ship.

## Mining Ship Progression

Mining ships are ORE faction (cross-faction, no empire skills needed).

```
Venture ──→ Mining Barges ──→ Exhumers
              │                  │
              ├─ Procurer ──→ Skiff (Tank)
              ├─ Retriever ──→ Mackinaw (Capacity)
              └─ Covetor ───→ Hulk (Yield)
```

> **Reference:** See `reference/mechanics/mining_ships.md` for complete ship specifications and comparison.

### Venture Stats

- **Ore Hold:** 5,000 m³
- **Mining Bonus:** +5% yield/level (Mining Frigate)
- **Special:** +2 warp core strength, gas harvesting bonus
- **Skill Required:** Mining Frigate I

### Recommended Path (Caldari Space)

1. **Venture** - Free from career agent
2. **Procurer** - Best tank for solo in any space
3. **Skiff** - T2 Procurer when ready for exhumers

Note: Caldari space (The Forge, Lonetrek) has good mining, but Jita proximity means more competition.

## Exploration Ship Progression

```
Heron (T1) ──→ Buzzard (Covert Ops)
                   │
                   └──→ Astero (Faction, optional)
```

### Exploration Frigates

| Ship | Class | Virus Strength | Scan Bonus | Special |
|------|-------|----------------|------------|---------|
| **Heron** | T1 Frigate | +5 | +7.5%/level | 400m³ cargo, 5 mids |
| **Buzzard** | Covert Ops | +10 | +10%/level | Covert cloak |
| **Astero** | Faction | +10 | +37.5% (fixed) | Combat capable |

### Heron Stats

- **Scan Bonus:** +7.5% probe strength/level
- **Virus Bonus:** +5 strength (role)
- **Slots:** 3H / 5M / 3L (5 mids = excellent for exploration)
- **Skill Required:** Caldari Frigate I

The Heron has the most mid slots of any T1 exploration frigate, allowing you to fit both analyzers plus shield tank or utility.

### Buzzard Stats

- **Scan Bonus:** +10% probe strength/level
- **Virus Bonus:** +10 strength (role)
- **Slots:** 3H / 5M / 2L
- **Special:** Covert Ops Cloak, warp while cloaked
- **Skill Required:** Covert Ops I (requires Caldari Frigate V)

## Industrial Ships

```
Badger (T1 Hauler) ──→ Tayra (Large Hauler)
                           │
                           └──→ Bustard (T2 DST)
```

| Ship | Specialty | Capacity |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Badger** | General hauler | 3,800 m³ base |
| **Tayra** | Large hauler | 5,500 m³ base |
| **Bustard** | Deep Space Transport | 62,500 m³ (fleet hangar) |

Caldari industrials emphasize raw capacity over specialized bays.

## Current Fleet Recommendations

Based on new player progression:

### Mission Running (L1-L2)
**Start:** Kestrel (L1) → Corax (late L1/early L2)
**Current:** Caracal (L2)
**Next:** Drake (L3) → Raven (L4)

### Mining
**Current:** Venture
**Next:** Procurer (safe) or Retriever (capacity)

### Exploration
**Recommended:** Heron → Buzzard when Caldari Frigate V trained

## Skill Requirements Summary

| Ship | Primary Skill | Level Needed |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| Kestrel | Caldari Frigate | I |
| Caracal | Caldari Cruiser | I (III+ recommended) |
| Drake | Caldari Battlecruiser | I |
| Cerberus | Heavy Assault Cruisers | I |
| Venture | Mining Frigate | I |
| Procurer | Mining Barge | I |
| Heron | Caldari Frigate | I |
