# Minmatar Ship Progression

Training roadmap for Minmatar pilots. Includes mining (ORE) and exploration paths.

## Minmatar Combat Philosophy

- **Primary Tank:** Shields (active) or Armor (buffer) - flexible
- **Primary Weapons:** Projectile turrets (autocannons/artillery), Missiles
- **EWAR Specialty:** Target Painting, Webs
- **Damage Types:** Selectable (projectiles use ammo for damage type)
- **Signature Trait:** Speed and agility

## Combat Ship Progression

### Frigates → Destroyers → Cruisers

```
Rifter (Projectile Frig) ──┐
                           ├──→ Thrasher (AC Dessie) ──→ Rupture (Projectile Cruiser)
Slasher (Tackle Frig) ─────┘                              │
                                                          ├──→ Stabber Fleet Issue
                                                          └──→ Vagabond (T2 HAC)

Breacher (Missile Frig) ───┐
                           ├──→ Talwar (Missile Dessie) ──→ Bellicose (Support Cruiser)
                           │                                │
                           │                                └──→ Huginn (T2 Recon)
```

### Primary Combat Lines

#### Projectile Line (The Minmatar Way)

| Ship | Class | Role | Key Stats |
|------|-------|------|-----------|
| **Rifter** | Frigate | Autocannon brawler | Fast, agile, iconic |
| **Thrasher** | Destroyer | Autocannon destroyer | High DPS, fragile |
| **Rupture** | Cruiser | Versatile cruiser | Good tank, solid DPS |
| **Stabber** | Cruiser | Fast attack | Speed tank, hit-and-run |
| **Vagabond** | HAC (T2) | Heavy assault | Extreme speed, selectable damage |

**Why projectiles for new players:** Selectable damage via ammunition. No capacitor use for weapons. Excellent falloff range allows flexible engagement distances.

#### Missile Line

| Ship | Class | Role | Key Stats |
|------|-------|------|-----------|
| **Breacher** | Frigate | Shield missile boat | Active tank + missiles |
| **Talwar** | Destroyer | Light missiles | 7 launchers, fast |
| **Bellicose** | Cruiser | Target painting support | Fleet force multiplier |

### Battlecruiser → Battleship

| Ship | Class | Role | Notes |
|------|-------|------|-------|
| **Hurricane** | Battlecruiser | Autocannons | Fast, hard-hitting BC |
| **Tornado** | Attack BC | Artillery | Alpha strike specialist |
| **Typhoon** | Battleship | Missiles/Torps | Flexible damage platform |
| **Maelstrom** | Battleship | Artillery | Shield fleet sniper |

### The Hurricane - Minmatar's Pride

The Hurricane is often considered the best battlecruiser in the game:
- Fast for its class
- Selectable damage types
- Works with autocannons OR artillery
- Excellent balance of tank and DPS

Many Minmatar pilots call it the "Cane" and never stop flying it.

## Mining Ship Progression

Mining ships are ORE faction (cross-faction, no empire skills needed).

```
Venture ──→ Mining Barges ──→ Exhumers
              │                  │
              ├─ Procurer ──→ Skiff (Tank)
              ├─ Retriever ──→ Mackinaw (Capacity)
              └─ Covetor ───→ Hulk (Yield)
```

> **Reference:** See `reference/mechanics/mining_ships.md` for complete ship specifications and comparison.

### Venture Stats

- **Ore Hold:** 5,000 m³
- **Mining Bonus:** +5% yield/level (Mining Frigate)
- **Special:** +2 warp core strength, gas harvesting bonus
- **Skill Required:** Mining Frigate I

### Recommended Path (Minmatar Space)

1. **Venture** - Free from career agent
2. **Procurer** - Best tank, especially important near low-sec borders
3. **Skiff** - T2 Procurer when ready for exhumers

Note: Minmatar space (Heimatar, Metropolis) borders low-sec frequently. Tank matters.

## Exploration Ship Progression

```
Probe (T1) ──→ Cheetah (Covert Ops)
                   │
                   └──→ Astero (Faction, optional)
```

### Exploration Frigates

| Ship | Class | Virus Strength | Scan Bonus | Special |
|------|-------|----------------|------------|---------|
| **Probe** | T1 Frigate | +5 | +7.5%/level | Fast, agile |
| **Cheetah** | Covert Ops | +10 | +10%/level | Fastest covops |
| **Astero** | Faction | +10 | +37.5% (fixed) | Combat capable |

### Probe Stats

- **Scan Bonus:** +7.5% probe strength/level
- **Virus Bonus:** +5 strength (role)
- **Slots:** 3H / 4M / 3L
- **Skill Required:** Minmatar Frigate I

The Probe is the fastest T1 exploration frigate, reflecting Minmatar design philosophy.

### Cheetah Stats

- **Scan Bonus:** +10% probe strength/level
- **Virus Bonus:** +10 strength (role)
- **Slots:** 3H / 5M / 2L
- **Special:** Covert Ops Cloak, warp while cloaked, fastest covops
- **Skill Required:** Covert Ops I (requires Minmatar Frigate V)

The Cheetah is prized for its speed - if something goes wrong, you're already gone.

## Industrial Ships

```
Wreathe (T1 Hauler) ──→ Hoarder (Ammo Hauler)
                            │
                            └──→ Mastodon (T2 DST)
```

| Ship | Specialty | Capacity |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Wreathe** | General hauler | 3,200 m³ base |
| **Hoarder** | Ammo bay | 41,000 m³ (ammo bay) |
| **Mammoth** | Large hauler | 5,000 m³ base |
| **Mastodon** | Deep Space Transport | 62,500 m³ (fleet hangar) |

Minmatar industrials are fast but lower capacity. The Hoarder's ammo bay is useful for hauling charges, crystals, and scripts.

## Current Fleet Recommendations

Based on new player progression:

### Mission Running (L1-L2)
**Start:** Rifter (L1) → Thrasher (late L1/early L2)
**Current:** Rupture (L2)
**Next:** Hurricane (L3) → Typhoon/Maelstrom (L4)

### Mining
**Current:** Venture
**Next:** Procurer (recommended - Minmatar space has low-sec borders)

### Exploration
**Recommended:** Probe → Cheetah when Minmatar Frigate V trained

## Skill Requirements Summary

| Ship | Primary Skill | Level Needed |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| Rifter | Minmatar Frigate | I |
| Rupture | Minmatar Cruiser | I (III+ recommended) |
| Hurricane | Minmatar Battlecruiser | I |
| Vagabond | Heavy Assault Cruisers | I |
| Venture | Mining Frigate | I |
| Procurer | Mining Barge | I |
| Probe | Minmatar Frigate | I |
| Cheetah | Covert Ops | I |

4. Shield Operation III (or Armor if preferred)

### Week 3-4: Destroyer Ready

## Ammunition Selection Guide

Projectile ammo determines your damage type. For missions:

| Ammo Type | Damage | Best Against |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| EMP | EM/Kinetic | Blood Raiders, Sansha |
| Phased Plasma | Thermal/Kinetic | Serpentis, Guristas |
| Fusion | Explosive/Kinetic | Angels |
| Titanium Sabot | Kinetic | General purpose |

Keep multiple ammo types in cargo - switch to exploit weaknesses.
