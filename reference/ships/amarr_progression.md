# Amarr Ship Progression

Training roadmap for Amarr pilots. Includes mining (ORE) and exploration paths.

## Amarr Combat Philosophy

- **Primary Tank:** Armor (heavy buffer or active rep)
- **Primary Weapons:** Energy turrets (pulse lasers/beam lasers), Drones
- **EWAR Specialty:** Tracking Disruption, Energy Neutralizers
- **Damage Types:** EM/Thermal (lasers deal fixed damage)
- **Signature Trait:** Capacitor-intensive but ammo-free weapons

## Combat Ship Progression

### Frigates → Destroyers → Cruisers

```
Punisher (Laser Frig) ─────┐
                           ├──→ Coercer (Laser Dessie) ──→ Omen (Laser Cruiser)
Executioner (Tackle Frig) ─┘                               │
                                                           ├──→ Omen Navy Issue
                                                           └──→ Zealot (T2 HAC)

Tormentor (Drone/Laser) ───┐
                           ├──→ Dragoon (Drone Dessie) ──→ Arbitrator (EWAR Cruiser)
                           │                                │
                           │                                └──→ Curse (T2 Recon)
```

### Primary Combat Lines

#### Laser Line (The Amarr Way)

| Ship | Class | Role | Key Stats |
|------|-------|------|-----------|
| **Punisher** | Frigate | Armor brawler | Excellent tank, 4 turrets |
| **Coercer** | Destroyer | Laser destroyer | 8 turrets, high DPS |
| **Omen** | Cruiser | Fast laser cruiser | Speed + beams |
| **Maller** | Cruiser | Heavy tank cruiser | Extreme armor tank |
| **Zealot** | HAC (T2) | Heavy assault | Fleet DPS platform |

**Why lasers for new players:** No ammunition cost - fire forever as long as you have capacitor. Frequency crystals last thousands of shots. Less logistics complexity.

**The challenge:** Fixed EM/Thermal damage means some enemies resist you well. Capacitor management is critical.

#### Drone/EWAR Line

| Ship | Class | Role | Key Stats |
|------|-------|------|-----------|
| **Tormentor** | Frigate | Drone/laser hybrid | Flexible engagement |
| **Dragoon** | Destroyer | Drone/neut boat | Energy warfare platform |
| **Arbitrator** | Cruiser | Tracking disruption | Fleet support, drones |

### Battlecruiser → Battleship

| Ship | Class | Role | Notes |
|------|-------|------|-------|
| **Harbinger** | Battlecruiser | Pulse lasers | Excellent armor BC |
| **Oracle** | Attack BC | Beam lasers | Long-range alpha |
| **Apocalypse** | Battleship | Beam/Pulse flex | Classic L4 runner |
| **Abaddon** | Battleship | Fleet BS | Massive armor tank |

### The Harbinger - Amarr's Workhorse

The Harbinger exemplifies Amarr design:
- Heavy armor tank
- Strong laser DPS
- Works with pulse (close) or beam (range)
- Capacitor-hungry but devastating

A well-skilled Harbinger pilot dominates L3 missions.

## Mining Ship Progression

Mining ships are ORE faction (cross-faction, no empire skills needed).

```
Venture ──→ Mining Barges ──→ Exhumers
              │                  │
              ├─ Procurer ──→ Skiff (Tank)
              ├─ Retriever ──→ Mackinaw (Capacity)
              └─ Covetor ───→ Hulk (Yield)
```

> **Reference:** See `reference/mechanics/mining_ships.md` for complete ship specifications and comparison.

### Venture Stats

- **Ore Hold:** 5,000 m³
- **Mining Bonus:** +5% yield/level (Mining Frigate)
- **Special:** +2 warp core strength, gas harvesting bonus
- **Skill Required:** Mining Frigate I

### Recommended Path (Amarr Space)

1. **Venture** - Free from career agent
2. **Retriever** - Amarr highsec is relatively safe, capacity over tank
3. **Mackinaw** - Extended solo operations in Domain

Amarr space (Domain, Tash-Murkon) is well-developed and relatively safe for mining.

## Exploration Ship Progression

```
Magnate (T1) ──→ Anathema (Covert Ops)
                     │
                     └──→ Astero (Faction, optional)
```

### Exploration Frigates

| Ship | Class | Virus Strength | Scan Bonus | Special |
|------|-------|----------------|------------|---------|
| **Magnate** | T1 Frigate | +5 | +7.5%/level | 4 lows for tank |
| **Anathema** | Covert Ops | +10 | +10%/level | Covert cloak |
| **Astero** | Faction | +10 | +37.5% (fixed) | Combat capable |

### Magnate Stats

- **Scan Bonus:** +7.5% probe strength/level
- **Virus Bonus:** +5 strength (role)
- **Slots:** 3H / 3M / 4L
- **Skill Required:** Amarr Frigate I

The Magnate has more low slots than other T1 explorers, allowing for better armor tank or cargo expanders.

### Anathema Stats

- **Scan Bonus:** +10% probe strength/level
- **Virus Bonus:** +10 strength (role)
- **Slots:** 3H / 4M / 3L
- **Special:** Covert Ops Cloak, warp while cloaked
- **Skill Required:** Covert Ops I (requires Amarr Frigate V)

## Industrial Ships

```
Sigil (T1 Hauler) ──→ Bestower (Large Hauler)
                          │
                          └──→ Impel (T2 DST)
```

| Ship | Specialty | Capacity |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Sigil** | General hauler | 3,100 m³ base |
| **Bestower** | Large hauler | 4,800 m³ base |
| **Impel** | Deep Space Transport | 62,500 m³ (fleet hangar) |

Amarr industrials favor capacity. The Bestower is a classic highsec hauler.

## Current Fleet Recommendations

Based on new player progression:

### Mission Running (L1-L2)
**Start:** Punisher (L1) → Coercer (late L1/early L2)
**Current:** Omen (L2) or Maller (tanky option)
**Next:** Harbinger (L3) → Apocalypse (L4)

### Mining
**Current:** Venture
**Next:** Retriever (Amarr space is safe, maximize capacity)

### Exploration
**Recommended:** Magnate → Anathema when Amarr Frigate V trained

## Skill Requirements Summary

| Ship | Primary Skill | Level Needed |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| Punisher | Amarr Frigate | I |
| Omen | Amarr Cruiser | I (III+ recommended) |
| Harbinger | Amarr Battlecruiser | I |
| Zealot | Heavy Assault Cruisers | I |
| Venture | Mining Frigate | I |
| Procurer | Mining Barge | I |
| Magnate | Amarr Frigate | I |
| Anathema | Covert Ops | I |

## Amarr Skill Priorities (New Player)

### Week 1-2: Foundation
1. Amarr Frigate III
2. Small Energy Turret III
3. Capacitor Management III (critical for lasers)
4. Armor Operation III

### Week 3-4: Destroyer Ready
1. Amarr Destroyer III
2. Small Energy Turret IV
3. Controlled Bursts III (reduces cap use)
4. Capacitor Systems Operation III

### Month 2: Cruiser Ready
1. Amarr Cruiser III
2. Medium Energy Turret III
3. Capacitor Management IV
4. Hull Upgrades III

## Capacitor Management for Laser Pilots

Lasers use capacitor instead of ammunition. Key skills:

| Skill | Effect | Priority |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Capacitor Management | +5% cap/level | **Critical** |
| Capacitor Systems Op | +5% recharge/level | **Critical** |
| Controlled Bursts | -5% cap use/level | High |
| Energy Grid Upgrades | Fitting for cap mods | Medium |

**Fitting tip:** Always check capacitor stability in the fitting window. For missions, 2+ minutes stable is ideal.

## Crystal Selection Guide

Frequency crystals modify range and damage. For missions:

| Crystal | Range | Damage | Best Use |
|---------|-------|--------|----------|
| Multifrequency | Shortest | Highest | Brawling, close range |
| Standard (Infrared, etc.) | Medium | Medium | General purpose |
| Radio | Longest | Lowest | Sniping, kiting |

T1 crystals never break. T2 crystals have better stats but degrade over time.
