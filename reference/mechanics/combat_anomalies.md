# Combat Anomalies Reference

Complete guide to combat anomaly sites, ratting basics, and escalation mechanics.

## What Are Combat Anomalies?

Combat anomalies are PvE sites that appear automatically in your probe scanner (no probing required). They contain waves of NPC pirates and provide ISK through bounties and loot.

**Key Difference from Missions:**
- No agent required
- Spawn randomly in systems
- Run them at your leisure
- No standings impact (positive or negative)

## Anomaly Difficulty Tiers

Anomalies follow a consistent naming pattern indicating difficulty:

### Progression (Easiest to Hardest)

| Tier | Highsec Name | Low/Null Name | Ship Class |
|------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | Burrow / Hideaway | Den / Hideaway | Frigate |
| 2 | Refuge | Refuge | Frigate+ |
| 3 | - | Rally Point | Destroyer |
| 4 | - | Hub | Cruiser |
| 5 | - | Haven | BC/BS |
| 6 | - | Sanctum | Battleship |
| 7 | - | Forsaken Hub | Battleship |
| 8 | - | Forsaken Rally | Battleship |
| 9 | - | Forlorn Hub | Battleship |
| 10 | - | Forlorn Rally | Battleship |

**Highsec Note:** Only tiers 1-2 spawn in highsec. Better anomalies require lowsec or nullsec.

### Faction Prefixes

| Prefix | Faction | Regions |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Serpentis | Serpentis Corporation | Gallente space |
| Guristas | Guristas Pirates | Caldari space |
| Blood Raider | Blood Raiders | Amarr space |
| Angel | Angel Cartel | Minmatar space |
| Sansha | Sansha's Nation | Amarr/South regions |

Example: "Serpentis Haven" = Tier 5 difficulty in Gallente null

## Ratting Basics

"Ratting" = running combat anomalies for bounties.

### How to Rat

1. **Open Probe Scanner** (Alt+P)
2. **Filter to Combat Sites** (green icon)
3. **Warp to appropriate anomaly** for your ship
4. **Kill NPCs** - bounties auto-deposit to wallet
5. **Loot/salvage** optional but adds income
6. **Move to next site** - repeat

### Ship Requirements by Tier

| Tier | Minimum Ship | Recommended |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| 1-2 | T1 Frigate | Destroyer |
| 3-4 | Destroyer | Cruiser |
| 5-6 | Cruiser | Battlecruiser |
| 7-8 | Battlecruiser | Battleship |
| 9-10 | Battleship | Marauder/Carrier |

### Tank Requirements

> **Reference:** See `reference/mechanics/npc_damage_types.md` for complete faction damage profiles and tank priorities.

Always tank against the faction's primary damage type. Match your resist modules to the faction you're fighting.

### Combat Tips

1. **Prioritize EWAR** - Kill jamming/damping ships first
2. **Range management** - Stay in your optimal
3. **Watch local** - PvP hunters frequent ratting systems
4. **Align out** - Always be aligned to a safe when in null
5. **Use drones wisely** - Recall when switching sites

## Escalation Mechanics

Completing certain anomalies can trigger "escalations" - multi-part combat chains leading to valuable loot.

### How Escalations Work

1. **Trigger**: Complete specific anomaly (usually killing final wave/structure)
2. **Notification**: Journal message with expedition location
3. **Travel**: Expedition spawns 1-5 systems away
4. **Chain**: Complete each stage for chance at next
5. **Reward**: Final room has best loot (faction/deadspace)

### Escalation-Capable Anomalies

Not all anomalies escalate. High-value escalation triggers:

| Anomaly | Escalation | Final Reward |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| Forsaken Hub | 6/10 DED | Faction modules |
| Forlorn Hub | 8/10 DED | Deadspace modules |
| Sanctum | 10/10 DED | Best deadspace loot |
| Haven (specific boss) | 10/10 DED | Depends on faction |

### DED Ratings Explained

DED sites are rated by difficulty (1/10 to 10/10):

| Rating | Difficulty | Ship Limit | Loot Tier |
|--------|------------|------------|-----------|
| 1-2/10 | Easy | Frigate | T1 meta |
| 3-4/10 | Medium | Destroyer/Cruiser | Faction (low) |
| 5-6/10 | Hard | Cruiser/BC | Faction |
| 7-8/10 | Very Hard | BC/BS | Deadspace (low) |
| 9-10/10 | Extreme | Battleship | Deadspace (high) |

### Escalation Tips

1. **Bookmark expedition location** immediately
2. **24-hour timer** - complete or lose it
3. **Stages can fail** - not every stage escalates further
4. **Ship restrictions** apply per DED rating
5. **Final boss** may require specific damage type

## ISK/Hour Expectations

Ratting income varies significantly by location, ship, and efficiency.

### Highsec Anomalies

| Activity | Ship | ISK/Hour |
|----------|------|----------|
| Burrow/Hideaway | Frigate | 2-5M |
| Refuge | Destroyer | 5-10M |

**Note:** Highsec ratting is not viable income. Use missions instead.

### Lowsec Anomalies

| Activity | Ship | ISK/Hour |
|----------|------|----------|
| Rally Point | Cruiser | 15-25M |
| Hub | BC | 25-40M |

**Risk:** PvP ganks significantly reduce effective ISK/hour.

### Nullsec Anomalies

| Activity | Ship | ISK/Hour | Notes |
|----------|------|----------|-------|
| Haven/Sanctum | Battleship | 30-50M | Bounties only |
| Haven/Sanctum | Marauder | 50-80M | With Bastion |
| Super Ratting | Supercarrier | 100-150M | Capital escalations |
| Carrier | Carrier | 60-100M | With fighters |

### Factors Affecting Income

**Increases ISK/hour:**
- Higher tier anomalies
- Better ship (faster clear times)
- System upgrades (more spawns in sov-null)
- Looting/salvaging (adds 20-40%)
- Escalation luck

**Decreases ISK/hour:**
- Travel between sites
- PvP interruptions
- Tank repairs
- Poor anomaly spawns
- Low-efficiency fits

### Realistic Expectations

| Player Type | Setup | Realistic ISK/Hour |
|-------------|-------|-------------------|
| New player (highsec) | Destroyer | 5-10M |
| Intermediate (nullsec) | VNI/Gila | 25-40M |
| Experienced (nullsec) | Ishtar/Rattlesnake | 40-60M |
| Veteran (nullsec) | Marauder | 60-100M |
| Capital pilot | Carrier/Super | 80-150M |

**Remember:** These are active play rates. AFK ratting is less efficient but requires less attention.

## Recommended Ratting Ships

### Highsec (Casual)
- **Catalyst** - Fast clear for tier 1-2
- **Algos/Dragoon** - Drone-based, low effort

### Lowsec (Risk-Aware)
- **Vexor Navy Issue** - Good tank + damage
- **Gila** - Shield tank, excellent drones

### Nullsec (Optimal)
- **Ishtar** - AFK capable, heavy drones
- **Myrmidon** - Budget VNI alternative
- **Rattlesnake** - High DPS, shield tank
- **Dominix** - Sentry drone sniper
- **Marauder (any)** - Bastion mode, top-tier

### Capital (Endgame)
- **Carrier (any)** - Fighter-based clearing
- **Supercarrier** - Maximum ISK/hour potential

## Safety Considerations

### Nullsec Ratting Safety

1. **Watch intel channels** - Corp/alliance intel is critical
2. **D-scan constantly** - Combat probes = incoming danger
3. **Stay aligned** - Warp out in <5 seconds
4. **Use local** - New names = potential threat
5. **Dock for neutrals** - Don't be a killmail

### Avoiding Common Deaths

| Death Type | Prevention |
|------------|------------|
| Roaming gang | Intel channels, dock up |
| Combat probed | D-scan, aligned out |
| Bubble caught | Align to multiple safes |
| AFK tackled | Don't AFK in dangerous space |
| Escalation ganked | Scout escalation systems |

## Quick Reference Tables

### Anomaly Tier by Security Status

| Security | Available Tiers | Best Sites |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| 1.0-0.5 | 1-2 | Refuge |
| 0.4-0.1 | 1-5 | Hub |
| 0.0 to -1.0 | 1-10 | Sanctum/Forsaken Hub |

### Escalation Value by Faction

| Faction | 6/10 Value | 8/10 Value | 10/10 Value |
|---------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Guristas | 50-200M | 200-500M | 500M-2B |
| Angel | 40-150M | 150-400M | 400M-1.5B |
| Serpentis | 40-150M | 150-400M | 400M-1.5B |
| Blood Raider | 50-200M | 200-500M | 500M-2B |
| Sansha | 100-300M | 300-800M | 800M-3B |

*Sansha escalations are highest value due to high-grade implant drops*
