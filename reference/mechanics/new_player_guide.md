## Early ISK-Making

### Tier 1: Immediate (Day 1-3)

| Method | ISK/Hour | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Career agents | N/A | One-time ~10M total |
| Tutorial | N/A | One-time rewards |
| Selling loot | Varies | From any combat |

### Tier 2: Sustainable (Day 4+)

| Method | ISK/Hour | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| L1 Missions | 2-5M | Steady, safe |
| SoE Arc | ~1-2M | Plus standings reward |
| Exploration | 0-50M | High variance |
| Mining | 1-3M | Predictable, boring |

### Tier 3: After Skills (Week 2+)

| Method | ISK/Hour | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| L2 Missions | 5-15M | Better rewards |
| Exploration (trained) | 10-100M | Skill dependent |
| Nullsec exploration | 20-200M | High risk |

### The Exploration Lottery

Exploration has high variance:
- Most sites: 1-5M
- Good sites: 10-50M
- Jackpot sites: 100M+

It's feast or famine. Missions are more consistent.

## Common Newbie Mistakes

### Don't Do These

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Do This Instead |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Flying what you can't afford to lose** | You WILL lose ships | Keep 10x ship cost in reserve |
| **Skipping the tutorial** | Miss free stuff and knowledge | Complete it fully |
| **Ignoring career agents** | Miss ~10M ISK + ships | Do all 5 careers |
| **Buying PLEX to sell early** | Terrible ISK efficiency | Earn ISK normally |
| **Autopiloting with cargo** | Gankers kill you | Manual pilot or use instant warp |
| **Trusting "double your ISK"** | It's always a scam | If it sounds too good, it is |
| **Joining random corps immediately** | Some are traps | Research first |
| **Fitting for max DPS only** | Die instantly | Balance tank and DPS |
| **Ignoring capacitor** | Tank fails mid-fight | See `capacitor_mechanics.md` |
| **MWD in PvE missions** | Signature bloom | Use afterburner |

### Scams to Avoid

| Scam | How It Works |
|------|--------------|
| **ISK doubling** | Send ISK, get nothing |
| **Contract bait** | Item looks valuable, isn't |
| **Hypernet bait** | Bad odds, overpriced items |
| **Free ship fleets** | Lured to lowsec and killed |
| **"Press Alt+F4"** | Closes your game |

**Rule:** If it seems too good to be true, it's a scam.

## Understanding the Interface

### Key Windows

| Window | Shortcut | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Inventory | Alt+C | Your items |
| Fitting | Alt+F | Ship fitting |
| Market | Alt+R | Buy and sell |
| The Agency | Alt+M | Find activities |
| Map | F10 | Navigation |
| People & Places | Alt+E | Contacts, bookmarks |
| Wallet | Alt+W | ISK and transactions |

### Overview Setup

Your overview shows objects in space. Default is bad.

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Open Overview Settings (hamburger menu) |
| 2 | Import "Z-S Overview" from community |
| 3 | Or manually add: Ships, Wrecks, Stations, Gates |

A good overview saves your life.
