# Wormhole Daytrips Guide

Your first forays into wormhole space. This guide covers everything you need to explore C1-C3 wormholes safely as a solo pilot, from finding holes to getting home alive.

## What is a Daytrip?

A daytrip is a short wormhole expedition:
- Enter through a known-space connection
- Run sites for ISK
- Return through your entry hole before it closes

You're not living in the wormhole - you're visiting for profit.

## Finding Wormholes

Wormholes appear as cosmic signatures in any system.

### Scanning for Wormholes

1. **Launch probes** - 8 probes in pinpoint formation
2. **Scan signatures** - Wormholes show as "Unknown" type
3. **Identify the signature** - At 25%+ it reveals "Wormhole"
4. **Scan to 100%** - Warp at range (20-50km) to observe first

### Wormhole Naming

| Name | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| K162 | Exit hole (someone came FROM here) |
| Specific ID (H121, C125, etc.) | Entry hole (you know where it leads) |

**Important:** Every wormhole is two-sided. Your "entry" is someone else's "K162."

---

## Reading Wormhole Info

Right-click → "Show Info" on any wormhole to learn critical details.

### Destination Clues

| Show Info Text | Destination |
|----------------|-------------|
| "Unknown parts of space" | C1, C2, or C3 wormhole |
| "Dangerous unknown" | C4 or C5 wormhole |
| "Deadly unknown" | C6 wormhole |
| "High security" | Highsec K-space |
| "Low security" | Lowsec K-space |
| "Null security" | Nullsec K-space |

**For daytrips:** Target "Unknown parts of space" (C1-C3).

### Stability Clues

| Show Info Text | Time Remaining |
|----------------|----------------|
| "not yet begun to decay" | >24 hours |
| "beginning to decay" | 4-24 hours |
| "reaching the end" | <4 hours |
| "on the verge of collapse" | <15 minutes |

**Rule:** Never enter a hole "on the verge of collapse."

### Mass Clues

| Show Info Text | Mass Status |
|----------------|-------------|
| "not disrupted" | >50% mass remains |
| "has had its stability reduced" | 10-50% mass remains |
| "critically disrupted" | <10% mass remains |

**Rule:** Avoid critically disrupted holes unless desperate.

## The Golden Rule: Bookmarking

**Bookmark your exit IMMEDIATELY upon entering a wormhole.**

This is not optional. This is survival.

### Bookmark Protocol

1. **Jump into wormhole** - You appear on the other side
2. **DO NOT MOVE** - Stay cloaked from the jump
3. **Create bookmark** - Right-click in space → "Save Location"
4. **Name it clearly** - "EXIT TO [system name]" or "HOME"
5. **Verify bookmark** - Check People & Places (Alt+E)
6. **NOW you can move** - Begin your daytrip

### Bookmark Naming Convention

| Name | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `EXIT Dodixie` | Exit to Dodixie |
| `HOME` | Your entry point |
| `SITE Gas 1` | Gas site bookmark |
| `SAFE 1` | Safe spot |
| `WH C2a` | Connection to another wormhole |

### If You Forget to Bookmark

1. **D-scan for the hole** - It might be within 14.3 AU
2. **Combat probes** - Can scan for wormhole signatures
3. **Scan ALL signatures** - Your hole is somewhere
4. **Don't panic** - Holes don't instantly close

---

## D-Scan Discipline

The Directional Scanner (V key) is your survival tool.

### D-Scan Settings for Wormholes

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Range | 14.3 AU (max) | Detect everything |
| Angle | 360° | Full coverage |
| Filter | Ships + Probes | What can kill you |

### D-Scan Rhythm

| Activity | D-Scan Frequency |
|----------|------------------|
| Warping | Before and after |
| Hacking | Every 3-5 seconds |
| Gas mining | Every 10-15 seconds |
| Combat sites | Every few seconds |
| Sitting still | Constantly |

**Muscle memory:** Hit "V" like a nervous twitch. Never stop scanning.

### What to Watch For

| D-Scan Shows | Threat Level | Action |
|--------------|--------------|--------|
| Nothing | Safe (for now) | Continue |
| Combat probes | **HIGH** - Being hunted | Cloak + move |
| Core probes | Low - explorer | Watch for ship |
| Ship (any) | **HIGH** | Cloak immediately |
| Sleeper wreck | Someone's here | Be cautious |
| Mobile Depot | Someone lives/visits here | Be cautious |

### The Combat Probe Warning

Combat probes can scan down your ship. If you see them:

1. **Cloak immediately**
2. **Move away from current position**
3. **Do not warp** (they can see where you go)
4. **Wait for probes to disappear**
5. **Leave the wormhole** if uncomfortable

---

## Safe Spots

Create safe spots in every wormhole you enter.

### How to Make a Safe Spot

1. **Warp between two points** (e.g., planets)
2. **Mid-warp, create bookmark**
3. **You now have a safe spot** off any warpable object

### Safe Spot Best Practices

| Practice | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Make 2-3 per system | Redundancy |
| Not aligned to celestials | Harder to find |
| 14+ AU from anything | Off d-scan from all points |
| Save in folder | Easy to find later |

### Emergency Safe Usage

1. Hostiles appear → Warp to safe
2. Cloak up
3. D-scan the wormhole exit
4. When clear, warp to exit and leave

---

## C1-C3 Site Types

These wormholes contain pirate faction sites (safe) and Sleeper sites (dangerous).

### Pirate Sites (C1-C3 Only)

| Site Type | NPCs? | Difficulty | Good For |
|-----------|-------|------------|----------|
| Relic (Ruined [Faction]) | No | Medium | ISK |
| Data (Central [Faction]) | No | Medium | ISK |

**These are identical to nullsec sites.** No special mechanics.

### Sleeper Sites (DANGEROUS)

| Site Name Contains | Ship Class | Difficulty |
|--------------------|------------|------------|
| Perimeter | Frigates | C1 (Easiest) |
| Frontier | Destroyers | C2 |
| Core | Cruisers | C3 |

**Warning:** Sleeper sites require combat ships, not exploration frigates.

### Gas Sites

| Site Name | NPCs? | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| All gas sites | Yes (delayed) | Sleepers spawn after ~15-20 min |

**Ninja gas mining:** Harvest for 15 minutes max, leave before Sleepers.

### Identifying Site Type

| Signature Name Contains | Type |
|-------------------------|------|
| "Forgotten" | Sleeper combat |
| "Unsecured" | Sleeper combat |
| "Ruined" | Pirate relic (safe) |
| "Central" | Pirate data (safe) |
| Any gas cloud name | Gas (ninja-mine only) |

---

## C1-C3 Difficulty Comparison

### Combat Site Difficulty

| Class | Sleeper Strength | Solo Ship Required |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| C1 | Frigates | Drake, Myrmidon |
| C2 | Destroyers + Frigates | Well-fit BC |
| C3 | Cruisers | Faction/T3 cruiser |

**For exploration daytrips:** Avoid Sleeper combat sites entirely.

### Relic/Data Site Loot

| Class | Loot Quality | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| C1 | Same as nullsec | Pirate faction sites |
| C2 | Same as nullsec | Pirate faction sites |
| C3 | Same as nullsec | Pirate faction sites |

**The value is equal** - C1 is safest for the same loot.

### Player Traffic

| Class | Typical Activity |
|-------|------------------|
| C1 | Beginners, daytrippers, PI alts |
| C2 | Small groups, krabbing corps |
| C3 | Active PvP groups, larger corps |

**Recommendation:** C1-C2 for safer daytrips.

## Exit Strategies

Things go wrong. Plan for it.

### Scenario: Exit Hole Camped

Someone is sitting on your exit.

**Options:**
1. **Wait** - They may leave (could be hours)
2. **Find another exit** - Scan for K162s or new connections
3. **Crash through** - Align, cloak, burn to hole (risky)
4. **Ask for help** - Corp mates, friends, etc.

### Scenario: Exit Hole Collapsed

Your hole closed naturally or was rolled.

**Options:**
1. **Don't panic** - You can scan out
2. **Find a new exit** - Scan all signatures for wormholes
3. **Chain through** - Enter other wormholes to find K-space
4. **Ask for help** - Post in rescue channels

**Wormhole Rescue Channels:**
- "EvE-Scout" - Signal Cartel rescue service
- "Wingspan Delivery Network" - Sometimes helps (sometimes hunts)

### Scenario: Hostile in System

You see a ship on d-scan.

**Immediate actions:**
1. **Cloak** - If you have one, use it
2. **Safe spot** - Warp to your safe
3. **D-scan exit** - Is the hole clear?
4. **Leave calmly** - Don't rush into a trap

### Scenario: Tackled at Site

You're pointed and can't warp.

**Options:**
1. **Overheat everything** - Maybe burn out of range
2. **Try to crash gate** - If near acceleration gate
3. **Accept fate** - You're probably dead
4. **Say "gf" in local** - Good etiquette

### The Mobile Depot Escape

If you brought a Mobile Depot:

1. Deploy depot in safe spot
2. Wait 60 seconds for it to anchor
3. Refit to warp core stabilizers
4. Attempt to warp through camps

This won't save you from a good camp, but it's a chance.

## Recommended Daytrip Fits

### Exploration Frigate (Relic/Data Focus)

Use your faction's exploration frigate:
- **Gallente:** Imicus (see `imicus_exploration.md`)
- **Caldari:** Heron (see `heron_exploration.md`)
- **Minmatar:** Probe (see `probe_exploration.md`)
- **Amarr:** Magnate (see `magnate_exploration.md`)

**Key modules:**
- Core Probe Launcher (mandatory)
- Cloak (mandatory)
- Data Analyzer + Relic Analyzer
- MWD for speed
- Inertial Stabilizers for escape

### Wormhole-Specific Adjustments

| Standard Fit | WH Adjustment | Why |
|--------------|---------------|-----|
| Cargo Scanner | Remove | Less useful in WH |
| Scan Rangefinding Array | Keep | Good probe strength helps |
| Shield Extender | Consider | Survive one volley |

### Ship Progression for Daytrips

| Stage | Ship | Capability |
|-------|------|------------|
| 1 | T1 Exploration Frigate | Relic/Data sites |
| 2 | Astero | Combat capability + cloak |
| 3 | Covert Ops (Helios, etc.) | Best probe strength + cloak warp |
| 4 | Stratios | Solo combat sites + exploration |

## Step-by-Step Daytrip Procedure

### Preparation (Before Undocking)

1. Check cargo: probes, depot, analyzers fitted
2. Set destination to lowsec/nullsec border (more holes)
3. Inform corpmates (optional safety)
4. Set clone to safe station

### Finding a Hole

1. Scan highsec/lowsec for wormholes
2. Check wormhole info: "Unknown" = C1-C3
3. Verify stability: "not yet begun to decay"
4. Verify mass: "not disrupted"

### Entry Procedure

1. Warp to hole at 0
2. Jump
3. **IMMEDIATELY bookmark exit**
4. Cloak (stay still)
5. D-scan 360° max range
6. Check for pilots in local (should be empty)
7. Note any ships/probes on d-scan

### Site Running

1. Launch probes
2. Scan all signatures (identify before warping)
3. Warp to pirate relic/data sites (NOT Sleeper sites)
4. D-scan constantly while hacking
5. Cloak between sites

### Exit Procedure

1. D-scan exit hole before warping
2. Warp to exit bookmark at 0
3. Check for bubbles/ships on landing
4. Jump immediately if clear
5. Verify you're in K-space
6. Warp to safe station

## Common Daytrip Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| No exit bookmark | Stranded, panic | Always bookmark first |
| Ignoring d-scan | Ganked | Scan constantly |
| Entering EOL holes | Stuck inside | Check hole status |
| Warping to Sleeper sites | Killed by NPCs | Learn site names |
| Bringing expensive ship | Expensive loss | Fly cheap |
| No probes/launcher | Permanently stuck | Always fit launcher |
| AFK in space | Easy kill | Never AFK in WH |

---

## Quick Reference Card

```
BEFORE ENTERING:
[ ] Probes in cargo (16+)
[ ] Probe launcher fitted
[ ] Cloak fitted
[ ] Mobile Depot in cargo
[ ] Hole status: NOT EOL

UPON ENTRY:
[ ] BOOKMARK EXIT IMMEDIATELY
[ ] D-scan 360° max range
[ ] Make safe spot

WHILE INSIDE:
[ ] D-scan every 5 seconds
[ ] Only warp to pirate sites
[ ] Cloak between sites

IF HOSTILE:
[ ] Cloak → Safe → D-scan exit → Leave

IF LOST:
[ ] Scan for new exits
[ ] Chain to K-space
[ ] Call for rescue
```

## ISK Expectations

| Activity | ISK/Hour | Risk |
|----------|----------|------|
| C1-C3 Relic Sites | 20-80M | Medium |
| C1-C3 Data Sites | 10-40M | Medium |
| Ninja Gas (15 min) | 10-30M | Medium |
| Combat Sites (with combat ship) | 30-100M | High |

**Note:** ISK requires selling loot on market (see pilot restrictions).

---

## Summary

| Concept | Key Point |
|---------|-----------|
| Bookmark | Exit IMMEDIATELY on entry |
| D-scan | Every few seconds, always |
| Site selection | Pirate sites only (Ruined/Central) |
| Hole selection | C1-C3, fresh stability, good mass |
| If lost | Scan out or call for rescue |
| Ship | Cheap exploration frigate |
| Mindset | Assume everyone is hunting you |

The wormhole doesn't care about you. Respect it and you'll profit. Get complacent and you'll die.

Fly safe, Capsuleer.
