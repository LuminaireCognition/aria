---

## Recommended Ships

### Best Choice: Faction Frigate

Use the L1 combat frigate for your faction:

| Faction | Ship | Fit Reference |
|---------|------|---------------|
| Gallente | Tristan | `tristan_l1_combat.md` |
| Caldari | Kestrel | `kestrel_l1_combat.md` |
| Minmatar | Rifter | `rifter_l1_combat.md` |
| Amarr | Punisher | `punisher_l1_combat.md` |

These fits are designed for exactly this content.

### Alternative: Destroyer

If you have the skills, a destroyer clears faster:

| Faction | Destroyer |
|---------|-----------|
| Gallente | Algos |
| Caldari | Corax |
| Minmatar | Thrasher |
| Amarr | Coercer |

Destroyers have more DPS but less tank. Fine for most missions, but watch for Dagan.

### The Gnosis Option

The Gnosis (Society of Conscious Thought battlecruiser) is:
- Given free to all accounts during certain events
- Requires no racial skills
- Overkill for this arc but works

---

## Arc Structure

The arc is divided into 7 chapters across multiple regions.

## Defeating Dagan

The final boss is the only real challenge.

### Dagan's Stats

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Ship | Gnosis |
| Tank | ~10,000 EHP |
| DPS | ~100-150 |
| Resist Hole | Kinetic |
| EWAR | None |

### Frigate Strategy

In a frigate:
1. **Orbit at 500m** with afterburner on
2. **Overheat weapons** if needed
3. **Pulse your repairer** - don't run it constantly
4. **Bring spare ammo** - fight takes a while
5. **Use Kinetic damage** if possible

The fight takes 5-10 minutes in a frigate. Patience required.

### If You're Struggling

Options if Dagan is too hard:

| Option | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Upgrade to destroyer** | More DPS, faster kill |
| **Ask for help** | Fleet up with another player |
| **Come back later** | Train skills, return |
| **Use drones** | Add Hobgoblins for extra DPS |

The mission doesn't expire. Take time if needed.

### Fleet Option

You can fleet with other players for Dagan:
1. Form fleet with friend
2. Both warp to mission
3. Focus fire Dagan
4. Only fleet member with mission gets standings

---

## The Faction Choice

After defeating Dagan, you choose which empire to support.

### The Choice

Sister Alitura asks you to deliver the mission item to one of four faction agents:

| Faction | Agent Location | Standing Gain |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| **Gallente Federation** | Dodixie | +8.75% (modified) |
| **Caldari State** | Jita | +8.75% (modified) |
| **Minmatar Republic** | Rens | +8.75% (modified) |
| **Amarr Empire** | Amarr | +8.75% (modified) |

### Which Faction to Choose?

| Priority | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Your faction** | Easiest choice, boosts your home space |
| **Trade hub access** | Caldari for Jita, Gallente for Dodixie |
| **L4 mission plans** | Whichever faction you want to run L4s for |
| **Lowest standing** | If one is negative, consider repairing it |

### Standing Implications

- +8.75% to chosen faction (before skills)
- Small negative hit to opposing faction
- Derived standing changes to allied factions

The opposing faction hit is minor. Don't worry about it.

### Repeating for Multiple Factions

You can run this arc every 90 days. Strategy:
1. First run: Boost your main faction
2. Second run: Boost secondary faction
3. Continue as needed
