# Incursions Basics Guide

Fleet-based PvE content with high ISK rewards and community coordination requirements.

## What Are Incursions?

Incursions are EVE's endgame fleet PvE content:
- **Sansha's Nation invasions** of empire space
- **10-40 player fleets** required
- **High ISK/hour** (150-300M/hour)
- **Community-organized** - Join existing groups
- **Highsec accessible** - Relatively safe

## How Incursions Work

### The Invasion

1. **Sansha spawns** in a constellation (announced in-game)
2. **Influence bar** appears - Sansha controls the area
3. **Sites spawn** - Various difficulties available
4. **Players run sites** - Reduce Sansha influence
5. **Mothership site** appears at ~0% influence
6. **Mothership killed** = Incursion ends
7. **New incursion spawns** elsewhere

### Incursion Effects

While an incursion is active in a constellation:
- **Reduced bounties** (50% reduction)
- **Reduced rewards** for other activities
- **Sansha NPCs** may appear in belts/gates
- **Cyno jamming** in some cases

## Site Types

### Vanguard Sites (10-11 pilots)

Entry-level incursion sites:

| Site | Time | ISK Payout | LP |
|------|------|------------|-----|
| Override Transfer Array (OTA) | 8-12 min | 15M | 1,500 |
| Nation Mining Colony (NMC) | 8-12 min | 15M | 1,500 |
| Nation Commander Outpost (NCO) | 8-12 min | 15M | 1,500 |

**Best for:** New incursion runners, faster sites

### Assault Sites (20-25 pilots)

Mid-tier sites:

| Site | Time | ISK Payout | LP |
|------|------|------------|-----|
| Nation Commander Stronghold | 15-20 min | 30M | 3,000 |
| Overwhelming Assault | 15-20 min | 30M | 3,000 |

**Less commonly run** - Fleets prefer VGs or HQs.

### Headquarters Sites (40 pilots)

High-end sites with best rewards:

| Site | Time | ISK Payout | LP |
|------|------|------------|-----|
| True Power Provisional HQ (TPPH) | 20-30 min | 31.5M | 7,000 |
| Nation Rebirth Facility (NRF) | 15-20 min | 31.5M | 7,000 |
| True Creations Research Center (TCRC) | 10-15 min | 31.5M | 7,000 |

**Best ISK/hour** - Most fleets focus here.

## ISK/Hour Breakdown

### Vanguard Fleets

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Site payout | 15M ISK |
| LP value | ~3M ISK (1,500 LP × 2,000 ISK/LP) |
| Sites/hour | 4-5 |
| **ISK/Hour** | **70-90M** |

### Headquarters Fleets

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Site payout | 31.5M ISK |
| LP value | ~14M ISK (7,000 LP × 2,000 ISK/LP) |
| Sites/hour | 3-4 (TCRC focused) |
| **ISK/Hour** | **135-180M** |

With efficient fleets: **150-200M/hour** is achievable.

## Fitting Basics

### Tank Requirements

Incursion sites deal **EM/Thermal** damage (Sansha):
- Tank EM > Thermal
- Hardeners required
- Buffer/active mix depending on community

### DPS Requirements

Communities require minimum DPS thresholds:
- **Snipers:** 600-800 DPS at range
- **Blaster ships:** 1000+ DPS close range
- **Leshaks:** 1200+ DPS (ramped)

### Cap Stability

Most fits should be:
- Cap stable with tank running
- Or cap stable for 10+ minutes minimum

### Example Entry Fit: Nightmare

```
[Nightmare, Incursion Entry]

Damage Control II
Heat Sink II
Heat Sink II

Tracking Enhancer II

Pith X-Type Large Shield Booster
Adaptive Invulnerability Shield Hardener II

**Note:** This is an example. Always use community-approved fits.

## Running Incursions

### Basic Protocol

1. **Join fleet** - Wait for FC invite
2. **Travel to staging** - Where fleet is based
3. **Check fit** - FC may inspect your ship
4. **Warp with fleet** - Don't warp alone
5. **Follow FC commands** - Anchor, shoot broadcasts, etc.
6. **Collect payout** - Automatic at site completion
7. **Warp to next site** - Repeat

### Fleet Commands

| Command | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| "X up" | Announce you're ready for fleet |
| "Align [location]" | Point your ship toward destination |
| "Anchor on [name]" | Follow that pilot's movements |
| "Shoot broadcasts" | Target and attack broadcast targets |
| "Spread points" | Warp disruptors on different targets |
| "Logistics, cap chain" | Logis transfer capacitor |

### Broadcast System

Fleets use broadcasts for coordination:
- **Target broadcasts** - What to shoot
- **Shield broadcasts** - Need healing
- **Capacitor broadcasts** - Need cap transfer

Learn to use broadcasts before joining.

---

## Logistics Basics

### The Logi Role

Logistics pilots keep the fleet alive:
- Watch for shield/armor broadcasts
- Lock broadcast targets
- Apply remote repairs
- Manage capacitor chain

### Cap Chain

Logistics ships form a "cap chain":
- Each logi sends capacitor to 2 others
- Maintains cap stability for all logis
- Critical for sustained healing

### Logi Priority

1. Other logistics
2. Fleet Commander
3. DPS taking aggro
4. Anyone else

**Never let a logi die** - Fleet wipes without healers.

---

## Safety Considerations

### Highsec Incursions

- **No PvP attacks** (CONCORD protection)
- **No bubbles**
- **Can dock freely**
- **Wardecs may matter** - Check for wars

### Lowsec/Nullsec Incursions

Incursions also spawn in lowsec/null:
- Higher rewards
- PvP risk
- Usually run by alliances

### Site Hazards

| Hazard | Effect | Counter |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Sansha DPS | High damage | Tank + logistics |
| EWAR (Niarja, etc.) | Tracking disruption | Tracking scripts |
| Tower aggro | Focuses one target | Call for reps |
| Late arrival | Miss contest | Stay with fleet |

---

## Entry Requirements

### Typical Community Requirements

| Requirement | Typical Minimum |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Ship | T1 Battleship (specific fits) |
| Tank | Community-approved fit |
| DPS | 600+ DPS (role dependent) |
| Skills | Battleship IV, weapons IV |
| Comms | Working microphone |
| Software | Mumble/Teamspeak/Discord |

### What to Bring

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Main ship | Incursion running |
| Mobile Depot | Mid-site refitting |
| Ammo variants | Damage type flexibility |
| Nanite paste | Overheat repair |
| Booster drugs (optional) | Performance enhancement |

2. Read all requirements and guides
3. Train minimum skills
4. Buy and fit entry ship (~400M)
5. Join channel, wait for fleet
6. Run 5-10 sites to learn

### Month 1: Improving

1. Upgrade to optimal ship (Nightmare, Vindicator)
2. Learn anchor positions
3. Understand spawn mechanics
4. Track ISK/hour
5. Consider logistics alt

### Long-term

1. Multiple incursion-ready ships
2. Logistics capability
3. Booster/FC potential
4. Run during off-peak for seat priority

## Common Questions

### Is it worth training for incursions?

**Yes, if:**
- You want consistent high ISK/hour
- You enjoy fleet gameplay
- You can commit 2-3 hour sessions
- You have ~400M for entry ship

**No, if:**
- You prefer solo gameplay
- You can only play 30-60 min sessions
- You dislike following instructions
- You want zero startup cost

### Can I multibox incursions?

Technically possible but:
- Most communities discourage it
- Logistics multiboxing is very hard
- Better to focus on one character well

### How long until I profit?

| Ship Cost | Hours to Recoup |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 400M (entry) | 3-4 hours |
| 700M (optimal) | 5-6 hours |
| 1B (blinged) | 7-8 hours |

Recoup time is fast compared to other PvE.

## Summary

Incursions are EVE's premier fleet PvE:
- **150-200M ISK/hour** for experienced pilots
- **Community-organized** - No need to form your own fleet
- **Skill-intensive** - Specific fits and training required
- **Time commitment** - Best in 2-3 hour blocks
- **Social content** - You will interact with other players

Getting started:
1. Join Warp To Me (beginner-friendly)
2. Fit a 400M entry battleship to their specs
3. X up in channel
4. Learn by doing
5. Upgrade ship as ISK allows

The ISK/hour is excellent, but the real value is the community and the challenge of coordinated fleet gameplay.
