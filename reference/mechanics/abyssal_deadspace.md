# Abyssal Deadspace Guide

Instanced PvE content with unique mechanics, time pressure, and high-value loot.

## What is Abyssal Deadspace?

Abyssal Deadspace is EVE's instanced dungeon content:
- **Solo or co-op** (1-3 ships depending on filament)
- **20-minute timer** - Complete or die
- **No escape** - Must finish to leave
- **Unique environments** - Weather effects modify combat
- **Guaranteed loot** - Every run drops something

## How It Works

### Entry

1. **Acquire filament** (market or drops)
2. **Fit appropriate ship** for filament type/tier
3. **Activate filament** in space (not docked)
4. **Portal opens** - Enter within 2 minutes
5. **Instance begins** - 20-minute timer starts

### Inside the Abyss

- Three "rooms" connected by gates
- Each room has enemies and hazards
- Kill all enemies to unlock gate
- Final room has loot cache
- Exit gate returns you to K-space

### Exit

- Complete all three rooms
- Loot the cache (optional but recommended)
- Take the exit gate
- Return to original location in space

**If timer expires:** Ship is destroyed. Pod is destroyed. No recovery.

## Filament Types

Filaments come in different types (weather effects) and tiers (difficulty).

### Weather Types

| Type | Environment | Effect |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Electrical** | Lightning storms | +50% capacitor recharge, -50% EM resist |
| **Firestorm** | Fire clouds | +50% armor HP, -50% thermal resist |
| **Exotic** | Plasma clouds | +50% kinetic damage, -50% kinetic resist |
| **Gamma** | Radiation | +50% shield HP, -50% explosive resist |
| **Dark** | Darkness | +50% turret range, -50% turret tracking |

### Choosing Your Weather

| Your Ship | Best Weather | Avoid |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Active shield tank | Gamma | Electrical |
| Active armor tank | Firestorm | Exotic |
| Turret DPS | Any (Dark is tricky) | Dark if low skills |
| Drone/missile | Electrical, Gamma | - |
| Capacitor-hungry | Electrical | Others |

### Tiers (Difficulty)

| Tier | Name | Solo Ship | ISK/Run |
|------|------|-----------|---------|
| T0 | Tranquil | Destroyer | 5-15M |
| T1 | Calm | Cruiser | 10-25M |
| T2 | Agitated | Cruiser | 20-40M |
| T3 | Fierce | Cruiser | 40-80M |
| T4 | Raging | Cruiser | 80-150M |
| T5 | Chaotic | Cruiser | 150-300M |
| T6 | Cataclysmic | Cruiser | 300M+ |

**Entry-level recommended:** T0 and T1

---

## Solo Filaments

### Ship Restrictions

| Filament | Allowed Ships |
|----------|---------------|
| Needlejack (T0) | Frigates |
| Electrical/Fire/etc. (Solo) | Cruisers only |

Solo filaments allow exactly one cruiser-class ship.

### Recommended Entry Ships

#### T0-T1 Entry: Gila

The Gila is the gold standard for abyssal running:
- Drone damage bonus
- Shield resistance bonus
- Passive income (drones work while you navigate)

```
[Gila, T1-T2 Abyss]

Drone Damage Amplifier II

10MN Afterburner II
Large Shield Extender II

Adaptive Invulnerability Shield Hardener II
Republic Fleet Medium Cap Battery

Rapid Light Missile Launcher II, Caldari Navy Scourge Light Missile
Rapid Light Missile Launcher II, Caldari Navy Scourge Light Missile

[Empty High slot]

Medium Anti-EM Screen Reinforcer II
Medium Core Defense Field Purger II
Medium Core Defense Field Purger II

'Augmented' Vespa x2
```

**Note:** This is a T2-fit example. T1 modules work for T0-T1 content.

#### Budget Alternative: Caracal Navy Issue

Cheaper than Gila but still effective for T0-T1:

```

```

### T2+ Considerations

Higher tiers require:
- T2 weapons minimum
- Faction/Deadspace tank modules
- Perfect skills in critical areas
- Significant ISK investment (500M+ fit)

**Do not attempt T3+ without extensive T1-T2 experience.**

## Enemies and Mechanics

### Enemy Types

| Enemy | Description | Priority |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Triglavian** | Ramping damage over time | High |
| **Drifter** | High alpha, strong tank | Medium |
| **Sleeper** | EWAR (neuts, webs, scrams) | Very High |
| **Drone** | Tracking disruption | Medium |

### Dangerous Spawns

| Spawn | Threat | Response |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Leshak (Triglavian BS) | Ramping damage | Kill fast or kite |
| Vila Swarmer | Neuts | Prioritize |
| Starving Lux | Webs | Kill immediately |
| Renewing Lux | Remote reps | Alpha down or ignore |
| Marshals (Drifter) | Doomsday at 0% shield | Don't face-tank |

### Environmental Hazards

| Hazard | Effect | Counter |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Filament clouds | Damage over time | Orbit around them |
| Trig towers | Continuous damage | Destroy them |
| Deviant Automata Suppressor | Prevents MWD | Use AB |
| Bioluminescent cache | Neuts capacitor | Destroy/avoid |

---

## Time Management

**You have 20 minutes. Ship and pod explode at 20:01.**

### Time Budget

| Phase | Target Time |
|-------|-------------|
| Room 1 | 5-6 minutes |
| Room 2 | 5-6 minutes |
| Room 3 | 5-6 minutes |
| Buffer | 2-4 minutes |

### Time Sinks

| Issue | Time Lost | Prevention |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Bad spawn | 1-3 min | Practice |
| Low DPS | 2-5 min | Better fit |
| Wrong ammo | 1-2 min | Pre-load correctly |
| Getting neuted | 1-3 min | Kill neut ships first |
| Poor piloting | 2-5 min | Practice |

### If Running Low on Time

1. **Ignore hazards** - Focus only on enemies
2. **Overheat everything** - Damage and tank
3. **Don't loot** in final room if sub-2 min
4. **Gate immediately** - Every second counts

---

## Loot

### Guaranteed Drops

Every completed run drops:
- **Triglavian survey data** (materials)
- **Filaments** (entry tickets)
- **Skill books** (chance)
- **BPCs** (chance)
- **Mutaplasmids** (chance)

### Valuable Drops

| Item | Tier Found | Value |
|------|------------|-------|
| Triglavian skill books | T1+ | 10-100M |
| Ship BPCs | T3+ | 50-500M |
| Mutaplasmids (good) | T2+ | 50-200M |
| High-grade implant BPCs | T5+ | 500M+ |

### Filament Recycling

Filaments drop from:
- Abyssal runs themselves
- Triglavian NPCs in K-space
- Market (player-sold)

You can sustain runs indefinitely with drops.

## ISK/Hour Analysis

### T0-T1 (Entry Level)

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Base loot | 10-20M |
| Run time | 15-20 min |
| Filament cost | 1-3M |
| **Net ISK/hour** | **25-50M** |

### T2-T3 (Intermediate)

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Base loot | 30-60M |
| Run time | 15-18 min |
| Filament cost | 5-10M |
| Ship loss rate | ~5% |
| **Net ISK/hour** | **60-100M** |

### T4+ (Advanced)

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Base loot | 80-200M |
| Run time | 15-18 min |
| Filament cost | 20-50M |
| Ship loss rate | ~10-20% |
| **Net ISK/hour** | **100-200M** |

**Loss rate matters.** A 3B ship lost every 10 runs destroys profit margins.

## Risk Management

### Causes of Death

| Cause | Frequency | Prevention |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Running out of time | Common | Better DPS, practice |
| Capacitor drained | Common | Kill neut ships first |
| Overwhelming damage | Occasional | Better tank, piloting |
| Disconnect | Rare | Stable connection |
| Pilot error | Common | Practice, focus |

### Insurance

Abyssal ships **cannot be insured** for death inside the Abyss. The loss is total.

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Start low** - T0-T1 until comfortable
2. **Don't overbling** - Expensive fits don't help if you die
3. **Practice the spawns** - Learn enemy priorities
4. **Know your limits** - If a room looks bad, you can still leave via gate

### The DC Problem

If you disconnect inside the Abyss:
- Timer keeps running
- Ship is likely dead
- No recovery possible

**Only run Abyssal content on stable connections.**

---

## Co-op Filaments

### Duo Filaments

Allow 2 frigates to enter together:
- Coordinate with partner
- Split DPS roles
- More forgiving than solo

### Trio Filaments

Allow 3 frigates:
- Fleet coordination required
- Very high DPS potential
- Communication critical

### Fleet Comp Example (Duo)

- **Ship 1:** DPS (Worm, Hawk)
- **Ship 2:** Support + DPS (Kitsune for EWAR, or another DPS)

---

## Mutaplasmids

### What Are They?

Mutaplasmids modify existing modules:
- Roll random stats
- Can improve or worsen
- Creates "Abyssal" modules

### Types

| Mutaplasmid | Target Modules |
|-------------|----------------|
| Gravid | Moderate variance |
| Decayed | High variance (risky) |
| Unstable | Highest variance |

### Gambling

Mutaplasmid rolling is gambling:
- Perfect rolls = Very valuable
- Bad rolls = Bricked module
- Average rolls = Slight value change

Most players sell mutaplasmids rather than roll them.
