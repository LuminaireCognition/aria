# Faction Warfare Overview

PvP-focused militia content with LP rewards and accessible solo entry points.

## What is Faction Warfare?

Faction Warfare (FW) is EVE's organized PvP system:
- Four empire militias fight for territory
- Capture and defend star systems
- Earn Loyalty Points for militia activities
- Mix of PvP and PvE elements

## The Four Militias

### Warzone Structure

| Militia | Faction | Enemy | Warzone |
|---------|---------|-------|---------|
| **Federal Defense Union** | Gallente | Caldari | Placid, Essence, Verge Vendor |
| **State Protectorate** | Caldari | Gallente | Black Rise, The Citadel |
| **Tribal Liberation Force** | Minmatar | Amarr | Heimatar, Metropolis, Molden Heath |
| **24th Imperial Crusade** | Amarr | Minmatar | Devoid, The Bleak Lands, Heimatar |

### Allied Militias

- Gallente + Minmatar (allied)
- Caldari + Amarr (allied)

You cannot shoot allied militia members (without consequences).

---

## Faction Warfare Mechanics

### System Control

Systems have a **control state**:
- Controlled by one militia
- Capture by running complexes (plexes)
- Defend by running defensive plexes

### Complexes (Plexes)

Plexes are FW-specific sites:
- Spawn in warzone systems
- Timer counts down while occupied
- Complete timer = System progress changes
- Enemy players will hunt you

### Plex Types

| Plex | Ship Limit | Timer | LP Reward |
|------|------------|-------|-----------|
| Novice | T1 Frigates, no drones | 10 min | ~10,000 LP |
| Small | Frigates, Destroyers (T1/T2/Faction) | 15 min | ~17,500 LP |
| Medium | Cruisers and below | 20 min | ~25,000 LP |
| Large | Battlecruisers and below | 20 min | ~30,000 LP |
| Open | No restriction | 20 min | ~35,000 LP |

**Defensive plexes** (in systems your faction controls) pay ~50% of offensive plex LP.

### System Tiers

Systems have tier levels based on overall militia control:

| Tier | LP Multiplier | Requirement |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| T1 | 0.5x | 0-20% control |
| T2 | 0.75x | 20-40% control |
| T3 | 1.0x | 40-60% control |
| T4 | 1.5x | 60-80% control |
| T5 | 2.0x | 80-100% control |

Higher tier = More LP per activity. Tier fluctuates based on warzone state.

## Solo PvP Entry

FW is EVE's best introduction to solo PvP.

### Why FW for Solo PvP?

1. **Ship restrictions** - Novice plexes limit ships to T1 frigs
2. **Predictable fights** - Know where enemies will be
3. **Low cost** - Lose T1 frigates, learn cheap
4. **LP income** - Get paid while learning
5. **Community** - Active player base

### Novice Plex Hunting

The basic solo FW loop:
1. Fit a cheap T1 frigate (~5-10M)
2. Enter novice plex
3. Wait for/hunt enemy frigate
4. Fight
5. Win LP, lose ship, or both
6. Repeat

### Starter Ships

| Faction | Ship | Style |
|---------|------|-------|
| Gallente | Incursus | Armor brawler, blasters |
| Caldari | Merlin | Shield buffer, blasters |
| Minmatar | Rifter | Speed, projectiles |
| Amarr | Punisher | Armor tank, lasers |

All four can fight in novice plexes. Cost: 2-5M ISK fitted.

### Basic Novice Plex Fit

Example: Merlin (Caldari)

```
[Merlin, FW Novice]

Damage Control I
Magnetic Field Stabilizer I

1MN Afterburner I
Warp Scrambler I
Stasis Webifier I
Medium Shield Extender I

Light Neutron Blaster I, Antimatter Charge S
Light Neutron Blaster I, Antimatter Charge S
Light Neutron Blaster I, Antimatter Charge S

Small Anti-EM Screen Reinforcer I
Small Core Defense Field Extender I
Small Core Defense Field Extender I
```

**Total cost:** ~3-5M ISK

## LP Farming

FW can be profitable even without PvP success.

### Defensive Plexing

"D-plexing" = Running plexes in friendly systems
- Lower LP than offensive
- Lower PvP risk (in backline systems)
- Can warp out if enemy appears

### Offensive Plexing

"O-plexing" = Running plexes in enemy systems
- Higher LP rewards
- Higher PvP risk
- Contributes to capturing systems

### LP/Hour Estimates

| Activity | Risk | LP/Hour |
|----------|------|---------|
| D-plexing (backline) | Low | 20-40k LP |
| O-plexing (frontline) | High | 40-80k LP |
| FW missions | Medium | 30-60k LP |

### LP Store Value

| Militia | Top Items | ISK/LP |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Gallente | Navy drones, implants | 1,500-2,500 |
| Caldari | Navy missiles, ships | 1,500-2,500 |
| Minmatar | Republic Fleet ammo, ships | 1,500-2,500 |
| Amarr | Navy crystals, implants | 1,500-2,500 |

**Typical conversion:** 1,000-2,000 ISK per LP

### ISK/Hour from LP

| LP/Hour | ISK Conversion | ISK/Hour |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| 30,000 LP | 1,500 ISK/LP | 45M |
| 50,000 LP | 1,500 ISK/LP | 75M |
| 80,000 LP | 1,500 ISK/LP | 120M |

Requires selling LP store items on market.

## FW Missions

### What Are FW Missions?

Faction Warfare agents give combat and supply missions:
- Similar to regular missions
- Occur in warzone space (lowsec)
- Significant LP rewards
- PvP risk while running

### Mission Types

| Type | Description | Risk |
|------|-------------|------|
| Combat | Kill enemy NPCs | Medium |
| Supply | Transport goods | Low |
| Propaganda | Distribute items | Low |

### Mission LP Rewards

| Mission Level | LP Reward |
|---------------|-----------|
| L1 | 5,000-10,000 LP |
| L2 | 10,000-20,000 LP |
| L3 | 20,000-40,000 LP |
| L4 | 40,000-80,000 LP |

Modified by warzone tier.

### FW Mission Tips

1. **Use fast ships** - Frigates/destroyers
2. **Tank for NPCs** - Enemies are faction-appropriate
3. **Watch local** - PvPers hunt mission runners
4. **Use insta-undock** - Bookmark undock locations
5. **Blitz when possible** - Objectives over kills

---

## Warzone Dynamics

### System Capture

Systems are captured through:
1. Militia runs offensive plexes
2. System reaches 100% contested
3. System becomes "vulnerable"
4. iHub is destroyed
5. System flips to capturing militia

### Defense

Systems are defended by:
1. Running defensive plexes
2. Reducing contested percentage
3. Killing enemy plexers

### Frontlines

The "frontline" is where most fighting happens:
- Contested systems between factions
- High PvP activity
- Best LP for offensive plexing
- Highest risk

### Backlines

"Backline" = Uncontested friendly systems:
- Lower LP rewards
- Lower PvP traffic
- Safer for mission running/D-plexing

## Ship and Fit Considerations

### T1 Frigates (Novice Plexes)

| Ship | Role | Strengths |
|------|------|-----------|
| Merlin | Shield brawler | High tank |
| Incursus | Armor brawler | Active rep |
| Rifter | Kiter | Speed, selectable damage |
| Punisher | Armor brick | Extreme tank |
| Tristan | Drone boat | Range flexibility |
| Kestrel | Rocket brawler | Selectable damage |
| Breacher | Shield ASB | Burst tank |
| Tormentor | Laser scorch | Range control |

### Faction Frigates

Faction frigates allowed in novice plexes:
- Firetail (Minmatar)
- Hookbill (Caldari)
- Comet (Gallente)
- Slicer (Amarr)

More expensive (~20-30M) but stronger.

### Ship Restrictions by Plex

| Plex | T1 | T2 | Faction | Navy |
|------|-----|-----|---------|------|
| Novice | Frig only | No | Frig OK | No |
| Small | Frig/Dest | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Medium | Up to Cruiser | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Large | Up to BC | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Open | Any | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## Risk Management

### Standing Consequences

Joining FW affects faction standing:
- Gain standing with your faction
- Lose standing with enemy faction
- Enemy highsec becomes hostile

### Leaving FW

You can leave FW at any time:
- Drop from militia
- Keep earned LP (use LP store first)
- Keep standing changes
- Repairing standing takes time

### Insurance in FW

Ships destroyed in FW combat are insurable. Budget for losses.

### Rule of Thumb

**Only fly what you can afford to lose.** FW involves constant ship losses.

## PvP Basics for FW

### D-Scanning

D-scan is critical in FW:
- Scan plexes before entering
- Identify enemy ships
- Decide fight or flight

### Target Selection

Know what you can fight:
- Your ship's strengths
- Enemy ship matchups
- When to engage vs. run

### The FW Fight Loop

1. D-scan plex
2. Assess enemy ship
3. Decide: Fight or skip?
4. Enter plex
5. Engage enemy
6. Win/lose
7. Analyze what happened
8. Repeat

### Loss Mindset

You will lose ships constantly. This is normal.
- Budget for 10+ losses per kill initially
- Every loss teaches something
- Cheap ships mean cheap lessons
- Expensive ships mean expensive lessons
