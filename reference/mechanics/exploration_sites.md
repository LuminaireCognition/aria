| Power Circuits | Medium | T2 Rig manufacturing |
| Burned Logic Circuits | Low | T2 Rig manufacturing |
| T2 Rig BPCs | Variable | Direct use/sale |
| Faction salvage | Medium | Faction rig manufacturing |

### Data Site Loot

| Item Type | Value | Used For |

| Decryptors | High | T2 Invention |
| Datacores | Medium | T2 Invention |

## Ghost Sites

High-risk, high-reward data sites with explosion mechanics.

### Types by Location

| Type | Location | Explosion Damage | Timer |
|------|----------|------------------|-------|
| Lesser | Highsec | 6,000 explosive | 90s-2min |
| Standard | Lowsec | 8,000 explosive | 60s-90s |
| Improved | Nullsec | 10,000 explosive | 45s-60s |
| Superior | Wormhole | 12,000 explosive | 30s-45s |

### Ghost Site Mechanics

1. **Hidden timer** starts when you warp in
2. **Failed hack** = immediate explosion (10km radius)
3. **Timer expires** = NPCs spawn, destroy remaining cans
4. **Only one attempt** per container

### Ghost Site Loot

| Item | Location | Approximate Value |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| Mid-grade Ascendancy BPCs | Highsec | 50-200M |
| High-grade Ascendancy BPCs | Low/Null | 200-500M |
| Mobile Depot BPCs | Lowsec | 20-50M |
| Covert Research Tools | All | 5-20M |
| Capital Component BPCs | Wormhole | 100M+ |

### Running Ghost Sites Safely

**Blitz Method (Recommended):**
- Fit explosive hardener + shield extender
- Hack one container maximum
- Warp out immediately after success or failure
- Accept you may die; ship should be cheap

**Tank Method:**
- Armor cruiser with explosive resist
- Can survive explosion + NPC damage
- More expensive, allows multiple attempts

## Sleeper Caches

Extremely dangerous sites with environmental hazards. K-space only.

### Types

| Type | Scan Difficulty | Ship Limit | Loot Value |
|------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| Limited | Medium | Frigate | 20-50M |
| Standard | Hard | Cruiser | 50-150M |
| Superior | Very Hard | Battleship | 200M-1B+ |

### Unique Mechanics

- **Requires BOTH** Data Analyzer and Relic Analyzer
- **Environmental hazards:** Damage clouds, sentry guns, timed explosions
- **Gated rooms** with ship size restrictions
- **No NPC defenders** (hazards are the threat)

### Sleeper Cache Loot

| Item | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Polarized Weapon BPCs | High | Exclusive to caches |
| Sleeper Blue Loot | Medium | NPC buy orders |
| Storyline Module BPCs | High | Rare drops |

**Advantage:** Contains salvage from ALL pirate factions in one site.
