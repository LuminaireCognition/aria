# DED Sites & Escalations Guide

Detailed guide to DED-rated complexes, escalation mechanics, and faction loot hunting.

## What Are DED Sites?

DED (Directive Enforcement Department) sites are rated combat complexes:
- Found via exploration scanning or anomaly escalations
- Rated by difficulty (1/10 to 10/10)
- Ship size restrictions per rating
- Best source of faction and deadspace modules

## How to Find DED Sites

### Method 1: Direct Scanning

DED sites spawn as cosmic signatures:
- Scan with combat probes
- Show as "Combat Site" type
- Name includes DED rating (e.g., "Serpentis Phi-Outpost 3/10")

### Method 2: Escalations

Combat anomalies can escalate to DED sites:
- Complete specific anomalies
- Chance to trigger escalation
- Journal notification with location
- 24-hour timer to complete

## Escalation Mechanics

### How Escalations Work

1. **Trigger**: Complete a specific combat anomaly
2. **Chance**: Not guaranteed (~5-20% depending on site)
3. **Notification**: Journal entry with expedition details
4. **Location**: 1-5 systems away (can be in different security)
5. **Timer**: 24 hours to complete each stage
6. **Chain**: Multi-stage sites (2-4 stages typical)

### Anomalies That Escalate

| Anomaly | Escalation | DED Rating |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Serpentis Forsaken Hub | Serpentis Paramilitary Complex | 6/10 |
| Guristas Forsaken Hub | Troop Reinvigoration Camp | 6/10 |
| Blood Forsaken Hub | Blood Coordination Center | 6/10 |
| Angel Forsaken Hub | Angel Military Operations | 6/10 |
| Sansha Forsaken Hub | Sansha Command Relay | 6/10 |
| Serpentis Sanctum | Serpentis Fleet Shipyard | 10/10 |
| Guristas Sanctum | The Maze | 10/10 |
| Blood Sanctum | Blood Naval Shipyard | 10/10 |
| Angel Sanctum | Angel Fleet Staging Point | 10/10 |
| Sansha Sanctum | Sansha Occupied Mining | 10/10 |

### Escalation Tips

1. **Bookmark immediately** - Don't lose the location
2. **Check security status** - Escalation may be in lowsec/null
3. **Time management** - 24-hour window, don't delay
4. **Each stage can fail** - Not every stage escalates further
5. **Final stage = Best loot** - Push to completion if possible

## Running DED Sites

### Site Structure

Most DED sites have:
- 2-4 rooms
- Acceleration gates between rooms
- NPC spawns in each room
- Overseer/Commander in final room (drops loot)

### Running Protocol

1. **Warp to site** at range (50-70km)
2. **Clear NPCs** in current room
3. **Approach gate** when clear
4. **Take gate** to next room
5. **Repeat** until final room
6. **Kill overseer/commander** - Loot drops here
7. **Loot wreck** - Check carefully for valuable drops

### Faction Spawns

Some sites have **faction spawns** (extra valuable):
- Named NPCs (e.g., "Shadow Serpentis Commander")
- Drop faction modules
- Not guaranteed to spawn
- Higher value than standard drops

### Loot Considerations

| Loot Type | Where |
|-----------|-------|
| Overseer effects | Commander wreck |
| Module drops | Commander wreck |
| BPC drops | Commander wreck |
| Implant BPCs | Final overseer only |

---

## Security Considerations

### Highsec DED Sites (1-4/10)

- **Competition**: Other players will scan and contest
- **Ninja looting**: Someone may steal your loot
- **Relatively safe**: No PvP risk from other players

### Lowsec DED Sites (4-6/10)

- **PvP risk**: Pirates hunt site runners
- **Gate camps**: May be caught traveling
- **D-scan constantly**: Hunters use probes

### Nullsec DED Sites (6-10/10)

- **Bubble camps**: Watch for dictors
- **Intel channels**: Use if available
- **Align out**: Always be ready to warp
- **High value**: Worth the risk if skilled

### Escalation Travel Safety

Escalations may send you through dangerous space:
- Scout the route first
- Use fast travel ship to check destination
- Consider selling escalation bookmark instead
- Accept that some escalations aren't worth running

## ISK/Hour Analysis

### Highsec DED Sites (1-4/10)

| Activity | Average Value | Time | ISK/Hour |
|----------|---------------|------|----------|
| 3/10 scanning | 20-50M (varies) | 15-30 min | 40-100M |
| 4/10 scanning | 30-80M (varies) | 20-40 min | 45-120M |

**High variance** - Some runs drop nothing valuable, others drop 100M+ modules.

### Nullsec DED Sites (6-10/10)

| Site | Average Loot | Time | ISK/Hour |
|------|--------------|------|----------|
| 6/10 | 50-150M | 30-45 min | 70-200M |
| 8/10 | 100-400M | 45-60 min | 100-400M |
| 10/10 | 200-1B+ | 60-90 min | 130-700M |

**Extremely variable** - BPC drops massively affect value.

## Fitting Recommendations

### Tank Priority

Always tank for the faction's damage type:

| Faction | Primary | Secondary |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Serpentis | Thermal | Kinetic |
| Guristas | Kinetic | Thermal |
| Blood Raiders | EM | Thermal |
| Angel Cartel | Explosive | Kinetic |
| Sansha | EM | Thermal |

### DPS Priority

Deal damage to enemy weakness:

| Faction | Weak To |
|---------|---------|
| Serpentis | Kinetic > Thermal |
| Guristas | Kinetic > Thermal |
| Blood Raiders | EM > Thermal |
| Angel Cartel | Explosive > Kinetic |
| Sansha | EM > Thermal |

### Sample 4/10 Fit (Vexor)

## Tips and Tricks

### Finding Sites Efficiently

1. **Scan in low-traffic systems** - Less competition
2. **Scan quickly** - Don't spend 30 min on one system
3. **Keep a list** of found sites (bookmark them)
4. **Return to sites** that were occupied later

### Maximizing Profit

1. **Run all stages** of escalations when possible
2. **Check faction spawn** - Don't miss valuable NPCs
3. **Loot everything** - Small items add up
4. **Sell smart** - Check buy order vs. sell order prices

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Wrong ship for rating | Can't enter | Check restrictions |
| Wrong tank | Die to NPCs | Research faction |
| Ignoring PvP risk | Die to players | D-scan, intel |
| Rushing loot | Miss valuable drops | Check wreck carefully |
| Letting escalation expire | Lose opportunity | Manage time |

## Summary

DED sites are EVE's premium PvE loot source:
- Scanned directly or triggered via escalations
- Rated 1/10 to 10/10 difficulty
- Ship restrictions enforce appropriate challenge
- Faction and deadspace modules are the prize
- High variance - big drops are rare but valuable

Start with 3-4/10 sites in highsec to learn mechanics. Progress to higher ratings as skills and ships improve. The 10/10 sites contain the game's most valuable PvE loot.
