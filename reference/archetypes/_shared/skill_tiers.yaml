# Skill Tier Definitions
#
# Defines what each skill tier represents in terms of training level
# and expected capability.
#
# New tier names (v2):
#   t1 -> Basic T1/Meta 0 modules, minimal skills
#   meta -> Meta/Compact modules, moderate skills
#   t2_budget -> Mix of T1/T2 modules, good skills
#   t2_optimal -> Full T2 modules, maxed relevant skills
#
# Migration from legacy names:
#   low -> t1
#   medium -> meta
#   high -> t2_optimal
#   alpha -> t1 (with omega_required: false)
