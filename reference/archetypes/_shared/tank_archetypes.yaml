      - "Resists to reduce incoming damage"
    common_ships:
      - "Drake"
      - "Rattlesnake"
      - "Gila"
    notes: "Famous for being 'AFK tank' - works while you focus on other things"

  shield_active:
    name: "Active Shield Tank"
    description: "Repairs shield damage using shield boosters"
    characteristics:
      - "Requires capacitor to operate"
      - "High burst tank potential"
      - "Can be cap injected for emergencies"
      - "Vulnerable to capacitor neutralization"

      rig:
        - "Core Defense Field Extender"
        - "Anti-specific damage rigs"
    fitting_priority:
      - "Cap stability or cap injection"
      - "Resists to reduce cap usage"
      - "Boost amount for burst tank"
    common_ships:
      - "Raven"
      - "Tengu"
      - "Golem"

# Faction-specific tank recommendations
faction_tank_preference:
  amarr:
    preferred: armor_active
    reason: "Armor bonuses, capacitor bonuses for active tank"

  caldari:
    preferred: shield_passive
    reason: "Shield resist bonuses, missile boats benefit from passive"

  gallente:
    preferred: armor_active
    reason: "Armor HP bonuses, hybrid boats need lows for damage"

  minmatar:
    preferred: shield_active
    reason: "Flexible, often speed-tanked with active shield"

# Cap warfare considerations
cap_warfare_resistance:
  armor_active:
    vulnerability: high
    mitigation:
      - "Cap batteries with neut resistance"
      - "Cap boosters for emergencies"
      - "Pulse repairer instead of continuous"

  armor_passive:
    vulnerability: none
    mitigation: []

  shield_passive:
    vulnerability: none
    mitigation: []

  shield_active:
    vulnerability: high
    mitigation:
      - "Cap boosters (common on active shield)"
      - "Cap batteries"
      - "Drugs (Blue Pill)"
