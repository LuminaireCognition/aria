# Omen Hull Manifest
#
# The Omen is an Amarr T1 cruiser specialized for lasers.
# Excellent capacitor management skills required due to laser cap drain.

hull: Omen
class: cruiser
faction: amarr
tech_level: 1

# Slot layout (from SDE)
slots:
  high: 5
  mid: 3
  low: 6
  rig: 3

# Drone/fighter capacity
drones:
  bandwidth: 30
  bay: 30

# Hull bonuses summary
bonuses:
  - "10% bonus to Medium Energy Turret damage per Amarr Cruiser level"
  - "10% reduction in Medium Energy Turret capacitor use per Amarr Cruiser level"

# Ship role classification
roles:
  - turret_boat
  - armor_tank

# Hull-specific fitting rules
fitting_rules:
  # Preferred tank type
  tank_type: armor_active

  # Weapon system
  weapons:
    primary: lasers
    secondary: drones  # Limited drone bay, utility only

  # Special instructions
  notes:
    - "4 turret hardpoints + 1 utility high"
    - "Lasers use EM/Thermal damage - cannot change"
    - "Heavy capacitor usage - train Controlled Bursts"
    - "Cap Booster often required for sustained combat"
    - "T1 crystals never break - carry all types"

# Recommended crystal loadout
crystal_recommendations:
  brawling: "Multifrequency M"
  general: "Standard M"
  sniping: "Radio M"
  note: "Crystals change optimal range, not damage type"

# Cap stability expectations
capacitor:
  stable_expected: false
  notes: "Lasers + active tank are very cap hungry. Expect to pulse modules or use cap booster."

# Typical engagement profile
engagement:
  range: "8-15km (pulse), 30-40km (beam)"
  speed: "approach with MWD, then brawl"
  signature: "medium - MWD blooms sig"
  notes: "Manage capacitor carefully. Pulse repper, don't run constantly."
