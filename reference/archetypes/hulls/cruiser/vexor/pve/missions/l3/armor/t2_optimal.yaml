    - "Kill order matters more - eliminate DPS ships first"
    - "Not recommended for newer pilots"

    - "T2 rigs are expensive - commit to this hull"
  playstyle:
    - "Speed clears reduce total damage taken"
    - "Better ISK/hour if you can manage the thinner tank"
    - "EC-300s essential for emergency extraction"
