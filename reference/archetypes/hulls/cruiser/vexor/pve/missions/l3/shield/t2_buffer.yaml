      notes: "Mixed enemies - default fit works."

notes:
  purpose: "Speed/buffer shield tank - clear sites fast"
  philosophy: "3x DDA + speed = faster clears, buffer buys escape time"
  engagement: "Kite at 30-50km with AB, drones do all damage"
  warnings:
    - "No active repair - buffer is your safety margin"
    - "Speed is your tank - keep AB running"
    - "Warp out if buffer gets low"
    - "Railguns are supplementary DPS only"
    - "Core probe launcher for scanning down escalations"
  advantages:
    - "Cap stable without active modules"
    - "Immune to capacitor warfare (neuts)"
    - "Higher base DPS than armor variants"
    - "Faster speed for positioning"
  disadvantages:
    - "Cannot recover HP in-site"
    - "Must dock to repair"
    - "Less forgiving of mistakes"
