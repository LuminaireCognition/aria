# Vexor Mission Fit Design

## Philosophy

The Vexor is a drone boat. Primary DPS comes from drones, not turrets.
This archetype prioritizes drone support and active armor tank.

## Slot Allocation

### Lows (5 slots)
- **2x Drone Damage Amplifier** - Core DPS multiplier
- **1x Medium Armor Repairer** - Active tank sustain
- **2x Resist modules** - Adaptive or faction-specific hardeners

### Mids (3 slots)
- **1x Propulsion** - MWD for range control
- **1x Cap Battery** - Sustain active tank
- **1x Drone Navigation Computer** - Drone speed for application

### Highs (4 slots)
- **1x Drone Link Augmentor** - Extended control range
- **3x Empty** - Intentionally unfitted. See hull manifest.

### Rigs (3 slots)
- **2x Auxiliary Nano Pump** - Rep amount
- **1x Nanobot Accelerator** - Rep speed

### Drones
- **5x Medium (primary)** - Main DPS, match to enemy weakness
- **5x Light (anti-frigate)** - Fast target cleanup
- **5x Light (utility)** - Alternate damage type or salvage

## Tier Progression

| Component | Low | Medium | High | Alpha |
|-----------|-----|--------|------|-------|
| DDAs | T1 | T1 | T2 | T1 |
| Repper | T1 Compact | T1 | T2 | T1 Compact |
| MWD | Enduring | T1 | Restrained | Compact |
| Cap Battery | Compact | Compact | T2 | Compact |
| Drones | T1 | T1 | T2 | T1 |
| Resists | EANM + Reactive | EANM + Reactive | T2 EANM + Reactive | EANM + Reactive |

## Cap Stability Notes

- Cap stable with repper running, not with MWD
- Pulse MWD to get into position, then let it cycle off
- Large Cap Battery helps significantly with sustain

## Drone Management

- Deploy mediums for cruisers and battlecruisers
- Swap to lights for frigates (better tracking)
- **Always recall drones before warping** - drone aggro can cause issues
- Keep an eye on drone HP - pull damaged drones back

## Faction Tuning

For faction-specific missions, swap resist modules:
- **Serpentis**: Kin/Therm resists, thermal drones
- **Guristas**: Kin/Therm resists, kinetic drones
- **Blood Raiders**: EM/Therm resists, EM drones
- **Angels**: Exp/Kin resists, may need rig swap for explosive

The base fit with EANM + Reactive Hardener works against all factions
but is less efficient than faction-tuned.
