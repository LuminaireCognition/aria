# Drake Mission Fit Design

## Philosophy

The Drake is the quintessential passive shield tank. Its legendary status in EVE comes from a shield recharge rate that exceeds most L3 incoming DPS. The fit maximizes shield HP and recharge while maintaining solid missile DPS.

## Slot Allocation

### Lows (4 slots)
- **2x Ballistic Control System** - Missile damage bonus
- **1x Damage Control** - Resist bonus to all layers
- **1x Drone Damage Amplifier** - Improves frigate-killing drones

### Mids (6 slots)
- **2x Large Shield Extender** - Raw shield HP
- **1x Adaptive Invulnerability Field** - Omni resist (only active module)
- **1x EM Shield Amplifier** - Plugs EM resist hole
- **1x Shield Recharger** - Faster passive regen
- **1x 10MN Afterburner** - Positioning, reduced incoming damage

### Highs (7 slots)
- **6x Heavy Missile Launcher** - Primary DPS
- **1x Empty or Utility** - Can add 7th launcher or utility

### Rigs (3 slots)
- **3x Core Defense Field Purger** - Essential passive tank rigs (+45% recharge)

### Drones
- **5x Light (anti-frigate)** - Only 25 bandwidth, lights only

## Tier Progression

| Component | Low | Medium | High | Alpha |
|-----------|-----|--------|------|-------|
| BCS | T1 | T1 | T2 | T1 |
| LSE | T1 | T1 | T2 | T1 |
| Adaptive | T1 | T1 | T2 | T1 |
| HML | T1 Compact | T1 | T2 | T1 Compact |
| Drones | T1 | T1 | T2 | T1 |

## Why Passive Tank?

The Drake's passive tank is legendary because:
- **No capacitor needed** - Immune to neuts (Blood Raiders love you)
- **Always on** - No buttons to press, tank works while you're managing drones
- **Predictable** - Shield recharge is constant, easier to plan
- **Simple** - Great for newer pilots, hard to mess up

Peak shield recharge occurs at 25% shields. The regen curve means you actually tank better when damaged!

## Missile Ammo Selection

Heavy missiles let you select damage type. This is a major advantage:

| Faction | Use Ammo | Resist Swap |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Serpentis | Scourge (Kin) | Add Thermal Amp |
| Guristas | Scourge (Kin) | Keep EM Amp |
| Blood Raiders | Mjolnir (EM) | Keep EM Amp |
| Sansha | Mjolnir (EM) | Keep EM Amp |
| Angel Cartel | Nova (Exp) | Swap to Exp Amp |
| Rogue Drones | Mjolnir (EM) | Keep EM Amp |

Default loadout: Scourge (Kinetic) - works against most factions.

## Frigate Problem

Heavy missiles apply poorly to frigates. Solutions:

1. **Light Drones** - Hobgoblins are your friends
2. **Wait it out** - Missiles will eventually kill them
3. **Target Painter** - Can swap Shield Recharger for TP

The light drone bay is small (25m3) so manage them carefully.

## Faction Tuning

For faction-specific missions, swap the EM Shield Amplifier:
- **Serpentis/Guristas**: Thermal Amplifier (Kin/Therm damage)
- **Blood Raiders/Sansha**: Keep EM Amplifier (EM/Therm damage)
- **Angel Cartel**: Explosive Amplifier (Exp/Kin damage)
