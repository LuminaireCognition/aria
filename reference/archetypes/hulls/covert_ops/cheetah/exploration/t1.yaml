notes:
  purpose: "Fastest nullsec/wormhole explorer"
  engagement: "Speed is survival - 2.8s align beats most lockers"

    - "Sub-3s align means most can't lock you before warp"
    - "Fastest Cloak+MWD execution of any CovOps"
    - "NOT recommended for Ghost sites - no buffer"
    - "Covert Ops Cloak II is NON-NEGOTIABLE"

  cloak_mwd_trick:
    - "Jump through gate - session change cloak active"
    - "Double-click in space away from gate"
    - "Activate MWD"
    - "Immediately activate cloak"
    - "MWD finishes - you're 12km+ away (fastest)"
    - "Align and warp while cloaked"

  decloaked_escape:
    - "Unlike other CovOps, Cheetah can escape decloaked"
    - "Align to celestial immediately"
    - "2.8s later - you're in warp"
    - "Most ships can't lock a frigate that fast"
    - "Doesn't work against instalockers"
