## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Sites Scanned | 45 |
| Sites Completed | 32 |
| Combat Sites | 8 |
| Data/Relic Sites | 24 |

## Activity Focus

Exploration is secondary income. Sites run opportunistically during mining downtime.

Primary interest: Data sites for BPCs and decryptors (invention preparation)

## Recent Discoveries

### YC128.01.08 - Blood Raider Data Site
- **Location:** Tash-Murkon
- **Site:** Crumbling Blood Raider Data Center
- **Loot:** Decryptor x2, datacores x5
- **Value:** ~18M ISK
- **Notes:** Saved decryptors for future invention

### YC127.12.28 - Sansha Relic Site
- **Location:** Domain
- **Site:** Decayed Sansha Temple
- **Loot:** Intact armor plates x4, power circuits
- **Value:** ~12M ISK
- **Notes:** Materials stored for T2 rig manufacturing

### YC127.12.15 - Combat Anomaly
- **Location:** Amarr system
- **Site:** Blood Raider Hideaway
- **Ship:** Omen
- **Bounties:** 2.4M ISK
- **Notes:** Cleared while waiting for manufacturing jobs

## Exploration Strategy

### Opportunistic Approach
1. Scan during mining cycles (5-minute windows)
2. Run sites during research job waits
3. Focus on data sites for industry materials
4. Sell relic loot, keep data components

### Equipment
| Module | Ship | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Core Probe Launcher I | Magnate | Basic scanning |
| Data Analyzer I | Magnate | Data site focus |
| Relic Analyzer I | Magnate | Secondary |

## Inventory of Exploration Materials

### Data Site Drops (Saved for Invention)
| Item | Quantity | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Parity Decryptor | 4 | +1 runs invention |
| Symmetry Decryptor | 2 | Balanced invention |
| Accelerant Decryptor | 1 | Faster invention |
| Mechanical Engineering Datacores | 18 | T2 invention |
| Amarrian Starship Engineering Datacores | 12 | T2 ships |

### Relic Site Drops (For T2 Rigs)
| Item | Quantity | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Intact Armor Plates | 15 | T2 armor rig component |
| Power Circuits | 28 | T2 rig component |
| Fried Interface Circuits | 42 | T2 rig component |
| Burned Logic Circuits | 35 | T2 rig component |

## Long-Term Plan

### Phase 1 (Current)
- Accumulate decryptors and datacores
- Build T2 rig material stockpile
- Train invention skills

### Phase 2 (Planned)
- Begin T2 invention research
- Manufacture T2 armor rigs
- Sell T2 products on market

### Phase 3 (Long-term)
- T2 ship invention (requires significant investment)
- Specialization in Amarr T2 ships
- Vertical integration: ore → minerals → T1 → invention → T2
