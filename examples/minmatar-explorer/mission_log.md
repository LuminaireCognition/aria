## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Missions | 42 |
| Epic Arc Completions | 1 |
| Distribution Missions | 28 |
| Security Missions | 14 |

## Mission Philosophy

Missions are not primary income. Run only for:
- Sisters of EVE epic arc (scan bonuses, exploration storyline)
- Standings repair when needed
- Distribution missions while waiting for wormhole chains

## Epic Arc Completions

## Mission Preferences

### Will Run
| Type | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Epic Arcs | Storyline, implants |
| Distribution | Zero risk, passive ISK |
| Courier | Same as distribution |

### Will Not Run
| Type | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Security L4 | Time better spent exploring |
| Mining | Not the playstyle |
| Faction warfare | Political entanglement |

## Standing Goals

| Faction/Corp | Current | Target | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|--------|---------|
| Sisters of EVE | 3.20 | 5.00 | SOE ship access |
| Thukker Tribe | 1.85 | 3.00 | Great Wildlands staging |
| Republic Fleet | 0.95 | 2.00 | Hek station services |

## Notes

Exploration is primary income. Missions are a means to an end:
- Standings for station access
- Quick ISK during downtime
- Epic arcs for storyline immersion
