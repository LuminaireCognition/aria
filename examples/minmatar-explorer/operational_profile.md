## Home Base

Nomadic pilot - "home" is temporary. These are current staging points.

- **Home Region:** Metropolis (temporary)
- **Primary Station:** Hek VIII - Moon 12 - Boundless Creation Factory
- **Secondary Staging:** Thera (when wormhole access permits)
- **Cache Locations:** Various (see Asset Staging)

## Operational Range

- **Security Preference:** All space. Comfort everywhere, fear nowhere.
- **Typical Operating Area:** Wormholes, NPC nullsec, lowsec
- **Primary Wormhole Class:** C1-C3 (solo capable)
- **Null Preference:** Great Wildlands, Curse, Venal (NPC stations)

## Ship Roster

Ships distributed across multiple staging points for nomadic operations.

| Ship | Hull Class | Role | Current Location |
|------|------------|------|------------------|
| Wind Walker | Probe | Disposable scout | Hek |
| Shadow Drift | Cheetah | Covert exploration | Hek |
| Storm Rider | Hound | Combat probing | Thera cache |
| Rust Never Sleeps | Vagabond | Combat/escape | Great Wildlands |

## Primary Activities

Ranked by preference:

1. **Wormhole Daytripping** - C1-C3 pirate relic/data sites
2. **Nullsec Exploration** - Sansha/Angel space for T2 salvage
3. **Ghost Sites** - High risk, high reward
4. **Combat Escalations** - When they proc from exploration

## Asset Staging

Distributed assets for nomadic resilience:

| Asset Type | Location | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Primary Ships | Hek | Main staging |
| Backup Cheetah | Thera | Wormhole staging |
| Loot Cache | Rens | For periodic sales |
| Escape Frigate | Great Wildlands | Emergency evacuation |
| Mobile Depot x5 | Cargo | Field refit capability |

## Faction Alignment

As a wanderer, faction matters less than freedom:

- **Cultural Alignment:** Minmatar (heritage)
- **No Mission Obligations:** Exploration is income
- **Hostile Territory:** Amarr space (standings issue)
- **Target Pirates:** Angel Cartel, Sansha (best exploration loot)

## Exploration Strategy

### Wormhole Chains
1. Scan highsec for C1-C3 connections
2. Map chain, bookmark everything
3. Run pirate sites (no Sleepers in C1-C3 pirate sites)
4. Exit before chain collapses

### Nullsec Runs
1. Stage in NPC null (Great Wildlands/Curse/Venal)
2. Run sites in surrounding sov-null
3. Use filaments for emergency extraction
4. Cache loot at NPC station

### Risk Management
- Always have exit bookmarks
- D-scan constantly
- Trust nothing, verify everything
- Acceptable loss: ship < loot value

## Operational Constraints

Full market access, minimal restrictions:

- Market trading enabled for loot sales
- Contracts permitted
- No home attachment - will relocate if needed
- Accept losses as cost of business
