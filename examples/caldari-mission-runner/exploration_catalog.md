# Exploration Catalog

<!--
  VOLATILITY: STABLE
  Historical record of exploration activities.
  ARIA: Reference for site patterns.

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Sites Scanned | 24 |
| Sites Completed | 18 |
| Combat Sites Run | 12 |
| Data/Relic Sites | 6 |

## Activity Focus

This pilot does not prioritize exploration. Sites are run opportunistically when:
- Discovered while traveling between mission hubs
- Combat sites spawn in mission deadspace
- Escalations proc from missions

## Notable Finds

### Combat Site Escalations
| Date | Site | Escalation | Result |
|------|------|------------|--------|
| YC128.01.08 | Guristas Scout Outpost | The Maze (3/10) | Dread Guristas modules (42M) |
| YC127.12.22 | Guristas Hideaway | None | Standard loot |

### Mission Deadspace Drops
| Date | Mission | Drop | Value |
|------|---------|------|-------|
| YC128.01.12 | Enemies Abound | Dread Guristas BCS | 165M |
| YC127.11.15 | Guristas Extravaganza | Pithum C-Type Invuln | 280M |

## Scanning Equipment

Exploration is not primary focus. Basic probing capability maintained for:
- Locating mission pockets
- Finding escalation sites
- Emergency scanning

| Module | Ship |
|--------|------|
| Core Probe Launcher I | Raven (utility high) |
| Sisters Core Scanner Probe x8 | Cargo |

## Notes

Combat anomalies are run occasionally when waiting for mission decline timers. Not a primary income source - mission running provides better ISK/hour for this character's skills and setup.
