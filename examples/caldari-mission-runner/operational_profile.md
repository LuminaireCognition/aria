# Operational Profile
<!--
  VOLATILITY: STABLE
  This file contains durable abstractions derived from operational patterns.
  ARIA may reference ANY data in this file proactively without staleness concerns.

## Home Base

These locations represent your established operational center - where your assets, ships, and operations are anchored. ARIA uses this to provide contextual advice without needing real-time location data.

- **Home Region:** The Forge
- **Home Constellation:** Kimotoro
- **Primary Station:** Jita IV - Moon 4 - Caldari Navy Assembly Plant
- **Mission Hub:** Motsu VI - Moon 6 - Caldari Navy Assembly Plant

## Operational Range

- **Security Preference:** Highsec (0.5+) for missions, lowsec for valuable tags
- **Typical Operating Area:** The Forge, Lonetrek, The Citadel
- **Low/Null Comfort:** Lowsec acceptable for tags; null avoided without fleet

## Ship Roster

Ships you own and their designated roles. This is your fleet, not your current boarding status.

| Ship | Hull Class | Role | Home Station |
|------|------------|------|--------------|
| Profit Engine | Raven | L4 Missions | Motsu |
| Market Shuttle | Crane | Trade runs | Jita |
| Blitz Runner | Jackdaw | Blitz missions | Motsu |
| Salvage Unit | Noctis | Post-mission salvage | Motsu |

## Primary Activities

Ranked by ISK/hour priority:

1. **L4 Security Missions** - Caldari Navy, Motsu hub
2. **Market Trading** - Regional arbitrage, Jita hub
3. **LP Conversion** - Navy faction modules/implants
4. **Salvage Operations** - Post-mission value extraction

## Asset Staging

Where your key resources are located:

| Asset Type | Location | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Mission Ships | Motsu | Close to L4 agent |
| Trade Goods | Jita | Market hub |
| LP Store Items | Jita | Listed for sale |
| Salvage Stockpile | Motsu | Accumulated mission salvage |

## Faction Alignment

Durable political stance (changes slowly with standings):

- **Primary Alignment:** Caldari State
- **Mission Provider:** Caldari Navy
- **Hostile Factions:** Gallente Federation, Minmatar Republic
- **Target Pirates:** Guristas (primary), Serpentis

## Mission Running Optimization

### Decline Strategy
- Always decline: Worlds Collide, Dread Pirate Scarlet
- Consider: Any mission >4 jumps from hub
- 4-hour decline timer tracked

### Blitz vs Full Clear
- Blitz: Missions with single objective
- Full clear: High-value salvage missions
- Switch ships based on mission type

### LP Conversion Focus
- Caldari Navy faction modules
- Navy issue implants
- Monitor LP/ISK ratios weekly

## Operational Constraints

Standard market-enabled gameplay:

- Full market access enabled
- Contract trading permitted
- Regional arbitrage active
- No self-imposed restrictions
