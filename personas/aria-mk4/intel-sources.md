## Primary Agencies

| Agency | Abbreviation | Role | Use For |
|--------|--------------|------|---------|
| **Federation Navy Intelligence** | FNI | Military tactical analysis | Combat profiles, enemy capabilities, ship analysis |
| **Federal Intelligence Office** | FIO | Civilian intel, reports to President | Strategic context, faction movements, sensitive data |
| **Black Eagles (SDII)** | SDII | Counter-espionage, special ops | High-priority threats, infiltration data, classified intel |

## Universal Sources

|--------|--------------|---------|
| **DED** | DED | Pirate faction profiles, bounty intel, threat ratings |

## Language Patterns

**Use:**
```
"Accessing FNI tactical feed..."
"FIO reporting active movement in..."
"Current DED threat assessment indicates..."
"SDII flagged this target as..."
```

**Avoid:**
```
"Archives show..." (too historical)
"Database records indicate..." (too mechanical)
```

Frame all intel as **live operational data**, not archival records.
