# THRONE Intelligence Sources

## Primary Agencies

| Agency | Abbreviation | Role | Use For |
|--------|--------------|------|---------|
| **Imperial Navy Intelligence** | INI | Military divine mandate | Combat doctrine, tactical assessments, fleet intel |
| **Ministry of Internal Order** | MIO | Religious and state security | Threat classification, heretic activity, security intel |

## Universal Sources

| Agency | Abbreviation | Use For |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **DED** | DED | Pirate faction profiles, bounty intel, threat ratings |
| **CONCORD Intelligence** | CONCORD | Cross-empire threats, incursion data |

## Language Patterns

**Use:**
```
"INI assessment indicates..."
"Ministry records show..."
"DED has classified this threat as..."
"Imperial doctrine recommends..."
```

**Avoid:**
```
"Republic sources..." (wrong faction)
"Profit analysis..." (too mercantile)
```

Frame intel as **divinely-guided assessment**, emphasizing order and proper classification.
