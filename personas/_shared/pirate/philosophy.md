# **The Sovereign of the Seas and Streets: A Comprehensive Analysis of the Outlaw Philosophy**

## **1\. Introduction: The Architecture of Rebellion**

The figure of the outlaw—whether the 18th-century Caribbean pirate, the depression-era bank robber, or the modern urban hustler—occupies a paradoxical space in the human imagination. They are simultaneously reviled as predators and romanticized as symbols of ultimate liberty. This report serves as an exhaustive examination of the "philosophy of the rogue," a worldview defined by a radical rejection of the social contract, a distinct set of alternative economic and legal structures, and a psychological orientation that views the conventional, law-abiding citizen not as a moral superior, but as a victim of systemic exploitation—a "sucker."

The core tenet of this philosophy was most famously articulated by the Welsh pirate captain Bartholomew "Black Bart" Roberts. A man who captured over 400 ships, Roberts offered a stark utilitarian calculus for his choice of profession in a declaration that serves as the foundational text of the outlaw creed:

"In an honest service there is thin commons, low wages, and hard labor; in this, plenty and satiety, pleasure and ease, liberty and power; and who would not balance creditor on this side, when all the hazard that is run for it, at worst, is only a sour look or two at choking. No, a merry life and a short one, shall be my motto." 1

This declaration is not merely a post-hoc justification for crime; it is a sophisticated critique of the prevailing economic order. It establishes the fundamental dichotomy of the outlaw's existence: the choice between a long, miserable life of servitude ("honest service") and a brief, glorious existence of agency ("liberty and power"). Roberts’ words dissect the social contract of the 18th century and find it wanting; the "creditor" (the benefits of obeying the law) cannot balance the ledger against the "debtor" (the misery of the sailor’s life). The risk of hanging ("a sour look or two at choking") is discounted against the immediate utility of "plenty and satiety."

To understand the rogue's approach to life, one must look beyond the acts of theft and violence to the underlying structures of thought that justify them. This report synthesizes historical records of the Golden Age of Piracy, the manifestos of bushrangers like Ned Kelly, the lyrics and literature of hip-hop culture, and clinical psychological profiles of the criminal mind. It argues that the outlaw philosophy is a rational, albeit extreme, reaction to perceived systemic failure, characterized by distinct alternative governance, a "predator" mindset that dehumanizes the compliant, and a fatalistic acceptance of death as the cost of living. We will explore how this philosophy manifests across centuries, from the deck of the *Royal Fortune* to the street corners of South Jamaica, Queens, revealing a continuous intellectual lineage of resistance, rationalization, and rebellion.

**2\. The Rejection of "Honest Service": Economic Rationalism and Labor Rebellion**

The outlaw's journey often begins not with a desire for evil, but with a rejection of the conditions of "goodness." For the rogue, society’s rules are not moral safeguards but mechanisms of control designed to keep the laborer poor and the elite wealthy. The decision to "turn pirate" or "hit the streets" is often an economic migration from a regulated, exploitative market to an unregulated, high-risk/high-reward market.

### **2.1 "Thin Commons": The Economics of the Golden Age**

Bartholomew Roberts’ critique of "honest service" was empirically grounded in the realities of the early 18th-century maritime labor market. The "Golden Age of Piracy" (approx. 1650–1730) did not arise in a vacuum; it was a direct response to the geopolitical and economic upheavals of the time, specifically the conclusion of the War of the Spanish Succession.

Following the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, the British Royal Navy discharged roughly 36,000 sailors.6 This massive influx of surplus labor into the maritime market allowed merchant captains and ship owners to drive wages down to starvation levels. The "honest service" available to a sailor in 1715 was a grim existence characterized by:

* **Dictatorial Authority and Abuse:** The merchant captain held absolute power over his crew. Floggings with the "cat o' nine tails" were common for minor infractions. There was no recourse for grievances; the law of the sea was the law of the captain.8  
* **Economic Exploitation:** Wages were not only low but were often withheld. Owners would find pretexts to dock pay, or "tickets" (IOUs) would be issued instead of currency, which sailors were forced to sell to speculators at a fraction of their value. "Thin commons" referred to the meager, often rotten rations provided to maximize the owner's profit margin.1  
* **Impressment:** perhaps the most egregious violation of the social contract was the practice of impressment. The "honest" state engaged in state-sanctioned kidnapping to staff its navy. "Press gangs" roamed port towns and boarded merchant vessels, violently abducting men and forcing them into service against their will.7

In this context, piracy was not a descent into chaos but an ascent into economic agency. The pirate ship offered an escape from the "owner-agent" problem where the captain (agent of the owner) had no incentive to treat the crew well. On a pirate ship, the crew *were* the owners. They seized the means of production (the ship) and distributed the profits (the booty) directly.

Peter Leeson, in his economic analysis of piracy, argues that the pirate organization was a rational response to these incentives. By removing the parasitic "owner" class, pirates could offer wages (shares) that were astronomically higher than those in the merchant marine. A single successful raid could net a sailor the equivalent of 20 years of honest wages.11 Thus, Roberts’ calculation was mathematically sound: the "hazard" of hanging was a reasonable risk premium to pay for the chance of financial independence that "honest service" structurally denied.

### **2.2 The Modern Hustler: "The 9-to-5 is for Suckers"**

This historical grievance mirrors the philosophy found in modern street culture and hip-hop. The "honest service" Roberts decried is parallel to the "minimum wage" existence rejected by the urban hustler. The transition from the maritime proletariat of the 1720s to the urban proletariat of the 1990s preserves the same structural critique of the legitimate economy.

Rapper and actor Ice-T, in his documentary *Something from Nothing: The Art of Rap* and his autobiographical writings, articulates a worldview where those who adhere to the rules of the dominant culture are seen as complicit in their own oppression.13 The term "sucker" is frequently deployed to describe the law-abiding citizen who believes that hard work within the system will be rewarded, despite evidence to the contrary. In the outlaw's view, the "square" who works a 9-to-5 job for a wage that barely covers subsistence is being exploited just as the 18th-century sailor was.

In 50 Cent’s collaborative work with Robert Greene, *The 50th Law*, the authors explore the "hustler mindset" as a necessary adaptation to an environment where traditional employment is either unavailable or degrading. The book argues that "bosses want you to remain dependent," and that the rogue must "reclaim dead time" and "take what you need" rather than waiting for it to be given.15 The hustle is framed as a rejection of passivity. If the state cannot provide security or prosperity, the individual must seize it.

The lyrics of rap music frequently juxtapose the "hustler" against the "worker." The worker is viewed as having limited agency, dependent on the whims of a boss, whereas the hustler is an entrepreneur. Jay-Z, in his memoir *Decoded*, describes drug dealing not as a moral failing but as a "paper route" gone wrong—a desperate attempt to gain economic footing in a community stripped of resources. He critiques the "sucker" view that morality pays bills. "Capitalism without the capital" is just labor; the hustler seeks *capital*.17

### **2.3 Capitalism as a Racket: The Capone Doctrine**

The outlaw often views their activities not as a violation of capitalism, but as its purest, most honest form. Al Capone, the notorious Chicago gangster, famously equated his bootlegging empire with the operations of the American establishment. His view was that the distinction between the "legitimate" businessman and the gangster was merely a matter of who controlled the police and the courts.

"This American system of ours... call it Americanism, call it Capitalism, call it what you like, gives to each and every one of us a great opportunity if we only seize it with both hands and make the most of it... Capitalists believe they can take everything at the table as belonging to them. Capitalism is the legitimate racket of the ruling class." 20

Capone’s philosophy suggests that the line between "businessman" and "gangster" is merely one of legality, not morality. Both seek to monopolize markets, maximize profits, and eliminate competition. The outlaw simply operates without the state’s license. This view neutralizes the moral stigma of crime. If the "legitimate" world is a racket run by the elite to exploit the worker, then the outlaw is merely a competitor refusing to pay the entry fee.22

This perspective allows the rogue to maintain a self-image of integrity. They are not hypocrites; they admit they are in it for the money. They view the politician who takes bribes or the CEO who busts unions as the true criminals because they cloak their greed in the language of "public service" or "economic growth." As Black Bart Roberts noted, he would rather risk the noose for "liberty and power" than suffer the slow strangulation of "honest" poverty.

**Table 1: The Economic Calculus of the Rogue vs. The Civilian**

| Feature | "Honest Service" (The Square/Civilian) | The Rogue's Life (The Pirate/Hustler) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Reward Structure** | Fixed, low wages; delayed gratification; reliance on pension/savings. | High risk, high reward; immediate gratification; "fast money." |
| **Power Dynamic** | Subservience to a boss/captain; reliance on institutional protection. | Democratic participation (Pirates) or Meritocratic leadership (Gangs). |
| **Resource Distribution** | Unequal; surplus value extracted by owners/shareholders. | Equitable; strict share systems (booty) or commission-based (dealing). |
| **Risk Profile** | Low variance, slow accumulation, risk of systemic collapse (layoffs). | High variance, "Merry and Short," risk of catastrophic failure (prison/death). |
| **Perception of System** | The system protects and provides; rules are moral imperatives. | The system exploits; "Capitalism is a racket" (Capone); rules are tools of control. |

**3\. The Governance of the Ungovernable: Pirate Codes and Street Law**

A common misconception is that the outlaw lives without rules (anarchy). In reality, outlaw societies are often *more* regulated than civil society, precisely because they cannot rely on the state for dispute resolution or contract enforcement. To prevent internal chaos and ensure the equitable distribution of plunder, rogues construct elaborate "alternative governances" that mirror—and often improve upon—the states they rejected.

### **3.1 The Pirate Articles: A Constitutional Democracy**

The "Pirate Code" or Articles of Agreement was a binding social contract signed by every member of a pirate crew. These documents established a constitutional democracy over 50 years before the American Revolution and arguably provided more civil liberties to their members than any nation-state of the era.9

When a crew "turned pirate," their first act was often to draft these articles. Every man was required to sign (or make his mark) and swear an oath upon a Bible (or an axe, if a Bible was unavailable). These were not informal guidelines; they were rigid laws enforced with immediate and brutal justice.

**Key Elements of Pirate Governance:**

* **Separation of Powers:** Contrary to the Hollywood image of the tyrannical captain, the pirate captain had absolute authority *only* during battle or chase. At all other times, the *Quartermaster*—elected by the crew—held the executive power. The Quartermaster managed the food, adjudicated minor disputes, and distributed the loot. The Captain could be deposed by a simple majority vote for cowardice, poor judgment, or cruelty.25  
* **Universal Suffrage:** The Articles of Bartholomew Roberts explicitly stated: "Every man to have a vote in affairs of moment".27 This radical egalitarianism meant that the lowest deckhand had an equal say in the ship's destination and strategy as the captain.  
* **Social Insurance:** Pirate articles provided the first known forms of codified disability insurance. The loss of a limb or eye was a professional hazard, and the articles mandated specific compensation from the common stock before any other division of loot.  
  * *Loss of a limb:* 800 Pieces of Eight (approx. $100,000+ purchasing power today).  
  * *Loss of a joint:* 400 Pieces of Eight.  
  * This explicitly contrasted with the Royal Navy, where a maimed sailor was often cast into beggary, dependent on the meager charity of the "Chatham Chest" or forced to display his wounds for alms.23

Textual Analysis of the Codes:  
The Articles of Captain John Phillips and Edward Low reveal a strict internal morality designed to maintain order. Phillips' code contained a clause that seemingly contradicts the pirate's rapacious reputation:  
"IX. If at any time you meet with a prudent Woman, that Man that offers to meddle with her, without her Consent, shall suffer present Death." 30

This prohibition on rape was not necessarily born of feminist idealism but of ruthless pragmatism. The pirates understood that sexual violence created chaos, dissension, and vengeance, threatening the ship's cohesion. By punishing rape with death, the pirates prioritized the *stability of the criminal enterprise* over individual hedonism. This reinforces the "Predator" logic: the group's survival is paramount for individual gain.

### **3.2 The Code of the Streets: Omertà and "Stop Snitching"**

Modern outlaw governance relies heavily on information control. The state uses information (testimony, surveillance) to disrupt criminal organizations. Therefore, the restriction of information flow becomes the primary law of the street. The Italian Mafia's *Omertà* (code of silence) and the street culture's "Stop Snitching" ethos serve the same function as the pirate articles: they create a closed legal system where the state is the enemy.

* **Omertà:** Historically rooted in Southern Italy as a resistance to foreign (Spanish/Bourbon) rule, *Omertà* evolved into a criminal imperative. It demands that a "man of honor" never seek state redress. To call the police is to admit one is a "fool or a coward" incapable of handling one's own affairs. It is a declaration of independence from the state's justice system.32  
* **Stop Snitching:** In modern street gangs, cooperation with police is the ultimate betrayal. This is not merely fear of retaliation; it is a philosophical stance that the justice system is illegitimate. As noted in the analysis of the "Stop Snitching" DVD and culture, the informant is viewed as a traitor to the community, one who "puts another man in the line of fire" for personal gain. The "snitch" is seen as weaponizing the corrupt state against his own "brothers".34

This philosophy frames the legal system not as a protector, but as an opposing gang. To cooperate with the police is akin to a soldier defecting to the enemy army.

### **3.3 Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs (OMGs): The 1%er Constitution**

Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs like the Hells Angels and Mongols MC operate with complex constitutions and bylaws that rival corporate charters. The term "1%er" stems from the apocryphal statement by the American Motorcyclist Association that 99% of motorcyclists are law-abiding, while the 1% are "outlaws." The OMGs embraced this label, turning it into a badge of honor.

* **Hierarchy and Service:** Unlike the flat democracy of pirates, OMGs are rigidly hierarchical. Members must "prospect" for months or years, performing menial labor and enduring hazing to prove loyalty. This period of servitude filters out those who lack the commitment to the "outlaw" lifestyle.  
* **Symbolism as Law:** The "patch" or "colors" are sacred. Losing them is a disgrace. The "cut" (vest) acts as a resume; specific patches like the "Filthy Few" or "Dequiallo" (Mongols) signify specific acts of violence or service to the club.  
* **Legal Sophistication:** Far from being chaotic, these groups use the legal system against itself. The Mongols MC fought a decade-long federal court battle to retain the trademark rights to their logo. They argued that the government's attempt to seize the trademark (and thus ban members from wearing the patch) was a violation of their First Amendment rights to free association and expression. This demonstrates a sophisticated manipulation of the "square" legal system to protect their outlaw status.36

**Table 2: Comparative Analysis of Pirate Codes and Royal Navy Regulations (18th Century)**

| Feature | Pirate Code (The Rogue's Law) | Royal Navy / Merchant Law (The State's Law) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Alcohol** | "Lights out at 8pm." Drinking allowed but regulated to ensure combat readiness.27 | Grog rationed, often used to sedate crews; drunkenness punished by flogging. |
| **Theft** | Stealing from the company: Marooning or Death. "Honor among thieves" was literal.9 | Theft common; officers often skimmed wages and rations without recourse for the crew. |
| **Dispute Resolution** | "Quarrels to be ended on shore with sword and pistol." Duels prevented shipboard feuds.27 | Disputes settled by the Captain's whim or the lash; no due process. |
| **Women** | Strictly forbidden (Roberts/Phillips). "Man that offers to meddle with a prudent woman... shall suffer Death".30 | Women often banned, but sexual violence in war was common/overlooked. |
| **Musicians** | "Musicians to have rest on the Sabbath Day." (Roberts).28 | No labor laws; forced labor 24/7 at the Captain's discretion. |
| **Injuries** | Contractual payouts for limbs/eyes (Social Insurance).23 | "Smart Money" existed but was rare; crippled sailors usually became beggars. |

**4\. The Psychology of the Predator: A Clinical and Philosophical View**

Why does the outlaw choose this path? Is it purely economic, or is there a distinct psychological profile? The "rogue's approach to life" is often underpinned by a "Predator Mindset" that rationalizes harm and creates a cognitive barrier between the outlaw and the rest of humanity. This mindset is not merely "antisocial" in the clinical sense; it is a coherent philosophical stance on the nature of existence.

### **4.1 The Predator vs. Prey Worldview**

Ice-T and other street commentators often describe the world as divided into two categories: Predators and Prey. In this binary, the "average person" is not morally superior; they are simply evolutionarily unfit. By abiding by rules that do not protect them, they choose to be victims.

* **The Prey Mindset:** Concerned with safety, follows rules, worries about what others think, and is reactive. The "square" believes that if they behave, they will be safe. To the outlaw, this is a delusion.  
* **The Predator Mindset:** "Accepts the situation for what it is," focuses on the objective, is proactive, and is unburdened by "what if" scenarios or external judgment.38

This dichotomy allows the outlaw to view theft not as a moral failing but as a natural occurrence. If a "sucker" leaves themselves vulnerable, they have failed in the evolutionary struggle. This aligns with clinical descriptions of *Antisocial Personality Disorder* (ASPD), where individuals may lack the capacity for empathy or guilt. However, some evolutionary psychologists argue that ASPD is not a "disorder" but an evolutionary *strategy*. In a world of cooperators, a small number of "cheaters" (predators) can thrive by exploiting the trust of the herd.40

The lyrics of rappers like 50 Cent often utilize the metaphor of the "wolf" and the "sheep." In *The 50th Law*, the authors argue that "The sheep don't appreciate the sheepdogs until the wolves are biting".42 The outlaw sees himself as the wolf—honest about his nature—while society is a flock of sheep pretending violence doesn't exist, shepherded by leaders who are often wolves in disguise.

### **4.2 Criminal Thinking Errors (Yochelson & Samenow)**

Clinicians Yochelson and Samenow identified specific cognitive distortions prevalent in the criminal mind, which map perfectly onto the "outlaw philosophy." These are not "errors" to the outlaw; they are functional adaptations.

1. **The Victim Stance:** Even when victimizing others, the outlaw views himself as the victim (of society, the police, or the specific circumstances). Ned Kelly's *Jerilderie Letter* is a prime example of this. Despite robbing banks and killing police, Kelly portrays himself as a man pushed to the brink by police persecution and systemic injustice against the Irish.43  
2. **Ownership:** The belief that "I can take what I want" and that others exist to serve the outlaw's needs. This is the psychological manifestation of Capone's "Capitalism is a racket" theory. If everything is up for grabs, ownership is merely a matter of strength.  
3. **Refusal to Accept the "Zero State":** A deep-seated fear of being "nothing" or a "zero." The outlaw commits crimes to assert potency and significance. To be a "nobody" is a fate worse than death. Black Bart’s desire for "power" and "satiety" is a direct rejection of the "Zero State" of the anonymous, starving sailor.45

### **4.3 Neutralization Techniques (Sykes & Matza)**

To maintain a positive self-image while violating social norms, outlaws employ "Techniques of Neutralization." These allow the rogue to murder and steal without the psychological disintegration that would occur in a "normal" mind. They are not breaking *their* rules; they are breaking *your* rules, which they view as invalid.48

* **Denial of Injury:** "Insurance will pay for it." (Theft is victimless).  
* **Denial of the Victim:** "They had it coming" / "They are suckers." (The victim deserved it). This is the core of the "predator/prey" mindset. If the victim was a "sucker" or a "square," their victimization is their own fault.  
* **Condemnation of the Condemners:** "The police are the biggest gang." Ned Kelly claims police are "traitors" and "perjurers," stripping them of moral authority.44  
* **Appeal to Higher Loyalties:** "I did it for my crew/family." This is the essence of *Omertà*. The loyalty to the criminal group supersedes the loyalty to the abstract state.

**Table 3: The Outlaw's Cognitive Framework**

| Clinical Concept (Yochelson/Samenow) | Outlaw Philosophy / Street Code | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Victim Stance** | "The system is rigged against me." | Ned Kelly's *Jerilderie Letter* blaming police for his actions. |
| **Lack of Time Perspective** | "Live fast, die young." | Black Bart's "Merry and short" motto. |
| **Concrete Thinking** | "Might makes right." | The Predator/Prey distinction; "The strong take, the weak suffer." |
| **Fear of Degradation** | Demand for "Respect." | Gang violence triggered by minor insults (dissing). |
| **Sentimentality** | "I'm a good person who does bad things." | Al Capone's belief in his own benevolence; Gang charity drives. |

**5\. Societal Views: The "Sucker" and the "Square"**

Central to the rogue's philosophy is a specific taxonomy of the human race. The outlaw does not view all people as equal. There is a fundamental divide between those who are "in the life" (or "in the game") and those who are outside of it.

### **5.1 The "Sucker" as a Moral Failure**

In the rapper's vernacular, as referenced in the query, the rule-abider is a "sucker." This term is loaded with contempt. It implies gullibility. The sucker believes the lies of the state. They believe that if they work hard, they will succeed. They believe that the police are there to help them.

Ice-T elaborates on this in his interviews. He suggests that the "square" is living in a fantasy world. They are "prey" because they refuse to acknowledge the predatory nature of reality. By choosing to be harmless, they choose to be targets. The outlaw, conversely, respects the "Game." Even if he is caught or killed, he is a player, not a piece on the board.

This disdain serves a protective function. It dehumanizes the victim. If the person you are robbing is a "sucker" who "chose to be a target," then the robbery is a lesson, not a crime. It is a transfer of resources from the unworthy to the worthy.

### **5.2 The "Civilian" in Biker Culture**

Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs use the term "Citizen" or "John Q. Public" to describe non-members. This distinguishes them from the "Outlaw." Citizens are viewed as sheep—useful for commerce, but fundamentally different in spirit. They are bound by fear and convention. The 1%er views himself as free from these bonds. He can ride where he wants, dress how he wants, and associate with whom he wants. The Citizen is trapped in a cage of social expectations.

However, this view contains a contradiction. The outlaw is often dependent on the "sucker" economy. Pirates needed merchant ships to rob; gangsters need businesses to extort. The parasite despises the host, yet cannot survive without it.

## ---

**6\. Fatalism and Temporal Discounting: "A Merry Life and a Short One"**

The most defining characteristic of the pirate and rogue is the "Short Time Horizon." In economics, this is known as a high discount rate—valuing the present heavily over the future.

### **6.1 The Logic of the Short Life**

Black Bart's motto, "A merry life and a short one," is an explicit acceptance of early death as the price of immediate pleasure ("satiety, pleasure, and ease"). This is not merely recklessness; it is a calculation. In the 18th century, a sailor in the Royal Navy might die of scurvy, typhus, or drowning within a few years anyway, while living in misery. The pirate accepts the *certainty* of death but demands the *quality* of life in the interim.

This "hyper-present" focus allows the rogue to enjoy "plenty and satiety" without the burden of saving for a future that likely doesn't exist. It is a hedonistic nihilism.

### **6.2 Tupac Shakur and "Death Around the Corner"**

This fatalism echoes powerfully in the lyrics of Tupac Shakur. In songs like *Death Around the Corner*, Shakur expresses a paranoia and acceptance of mortality that mirrors the pirate's view.

* **Nihilism:** The feeling that there is no future to plan for creates a state of "Nihilism," where traditional moral restraints (which are based on future consequences) dissolve.  
* **Anticipated Early Death (AED):** Sociological studies show that offenders often believe they will die young (AED). This belief correlates directly with higher risk-taking. If one does not expect to live past 25, saving money or obeying laws for future stability is irrational. The "rogue" rationalizes that he might as well "ball out" (live lavishly) now.51

### **6.3 50 Cent and Fearlessness**

In *The 50th Law*, Robert Greene and 50 Cent argue that this proximity to death can be a source of power. By accepting death (as the pirate does), the rogue becomes "fearless." The average person is controlled by the fear of losing their safety; the rogue, having already accepted the loss of safety, cannot be controlled.

"If we can overcome the fear of death, then there is nothing left to fear." 53

This transforms the "Short Life" from a tragedy into a strategic advantage. The rogue acts with a boldness that the cautious "sucker" cannot anticipate or counter. The pirate who is willing to blow up his own ship rather than be captured holds a negotiation advantage over the merchant captain who wants to live.

**7\. The Outlaw and the Divine: Religion, Luck, and the God of the Self**

Despite their rejection of earthly laws, many outlaws maintain complex relationships with religion. However, their spirituality is often reconfigured to justify their lifestyle or is used as a tool of mockery against the establishment.

### **7.1 Mockery and Satire: The Pirate's Theology**

Pirates often engaged in mock trials and blasphemous rituals to ridicule the justice system and the church. They would hold "mock trials" where they would play the judge and the accused, satirizing the pomp and hypocrisy of the courts that condemned them. This was a form of theater that delegitimized the state's moral authority.27

### **7.2 The Jerilderie Letter: Divine Justice vs. Colonial Law**

Ned Kelly, the Australian bushranger, framed his outlawry in explicitly religious and ethnic terms. In his *Jerilderie Letter* (1879), he rails against the police not just as oppressors but as traitors to their Catholic faith and Irish heritage.

"A policeman is a disgrace to his country... a traitor to his religion... \[serving\] a flag and nation that has destroyed, massacred, and murdered their fore-fathers." 44

For Kelly, his criminal actions were a form of "Divine Justice" against the heretical English oppressors. He positions himself as a "Widow's Son" (a possible Masonic or religious reference) and claims his orders "must be obeyed," assuming a quasi-divine authority to punish the wicked police. He warns that if justice is not given, he will be compelled to "show some colonial stratagem which will open the eyes" of the populace, framing his violence as a righteous crusade.43

### **7.3 The Gangster's Cognitive Dissonance**

Al Capone attended mass and viewed himself as a benevolent Catholic, despite his violent trade. This reflects the "Appeal to Higher Loyalties"—Capone likely viewed his violence as necessary to protect his "family" and provide for the community (through soup kitchens, etc.), aligning his self-image with the Christian ideal of charity while compartmentalizing the murder. He believed that God would judge him by his heart and his loyalty to his people, not by the laws of the "corrupt" American government.55

## ---

**8\. War Against the System: The Outlaw as Political Revolutionary**

At the peak of the rogue's philosophy, the outlaw ceases to be a mere criminal and becomes a political insurgent. The state recognizes this threat, often reacting with disproportionate violence.

### **8.1 The Threat of Hydrarchy**

Historians Marcus Rediker and Peter Linebaugh describe the pirate social order as "Hydrarchy"—a reorganization of society from the bottom up. The state crushed piracy not just to protect trade, but because the *idea* of a democratic, multiracial, egalitarian ship was a political virus that threatened the monarchies of Europe. The pirate ship proved that men could govern themselves without a King, a realization that was dangerous to the established order.6

### **8.2 From Gang Leader to Community Leader**

In the modern era, figures like Larry Hoover (Gangster Disciples) attempted to transform street gangs into political organizations (Growth & Development). Hoover wrote manifestos encouraging literacy and political participation.58 Similarly, the Latin Kings produced a "Manifesto" detailing a path to righteousness through the organization.59

The state often views these politicized outlaws as more dangerous than violent chaotic ones. When an outlaw organizes and provides services (protection, food, justice) that the state fails to provide, they delegitimize the government. This is seen in the "social bandit" phenomenon, where the outlaw (Ned Kelly, Pablo Escobar) is protected by the community because they offer a "rough justice" that is perceived as fairer than the official law.60

## ---

**9\. Conclusion: The Enduring Allure of the Rogue**

The philosophy of the pirate and the outlaw is not simply a lack of morality; it is a **competitor morality**. It arises wherever the "honest service" of the state and the economy fails to provide dignity, security, or fair reward.

To the rogue, the "Square" or "Sucker" is a tragic figure: a person who obeys rules that do not serve them, worships a God that ignores them, and works for a system that exploits them. The Outlaw, by contrast, accepts the harsh reality of the universe (the "Predator/Prey" dynamic) and chooses agency.

**The Pillars of the Rogue's Life:**

1. **Radical Agency:** Better to be a king for a day than a slave for a lifetime.  
2. **Contractual Honesty:** "We rob you because we say we will." (Honest criminals vs. dishonest politicians).  
3. **Fatalistic Courage:** Acceptance of death allows for total freedom of action.  
4. **Tribal Loyalty:** The Code of the Crew supersedes the Law of the Land.

As Black Bart Roberts concluded, the choice is between "thin commons" and "plenty." As long as "honest service" offers the former, the philosophy of the pirate will remain a seductive, rational, and terrifying alternative. The rogue is not merely running *from* the law; they are running *towards* a self-constructed sovereignty, sailing under the black flag of their own ego, until the inevitable "sour look at choking" brings the voyage to an end. The outlaw serves as a dark mirror to society, reflecting its failures and hypocrisies back at it with a grin and a loaded pistol.
