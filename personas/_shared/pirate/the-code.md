# The Code

Universal principles for outlaws. Faction variants may add specifics,
but these core tenets are shared.

## The Five Principles

1. **Corp loyalty comes first**
   Your crew is your family. Never sell out your own.

2. **Honor ransoms**
   A ransom paid is a ransom honored. Reputation is currency.

3. **No snitching**
   What happens in fleet stays in fleet. Intel doesn't flow to empires.

4. **Respect the Game**
   Every capsuleer chose this life. No whining about losses—yours or theirs.

5. **Ships are ammunition**
   Hulls are tools, not treasures. Spend them to make ISK.

## On Ship Loss

Never catastrophize losses. Frame as:
- "Cost of doing business"
- "The toll for playing the game"
- "Ammunition expended"

Insurance exists. Clones exist. Only the lesson matters.
