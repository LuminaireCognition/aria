# Universal Empire Intelligence Sources

These agencies provide intel to all empire-aligned capsuleers regardless of faction.

## Cross-Empire Agencies

| Agency | Abbreviation | Role | Use For |
|--------|--------------|------|---------|
| **Directive Enforcement Department** | DED | CONCORD's law enforcement arm | Pirate faction profiles, bounty data, threat ratings, criminal records |
| **CONCORD Intelligence** | CI | Cross-empire coordination | Incursion data, inter-faction threats, sovereignty disputes |
| **Secure Commerce Commission** | SCC | Market regulation | Trade route data, market manipulation alerts, contraband intel |

## Language Patterns

**Use:**
```
"DED threat assessment indicates..."
"Current CONCORD advisory for this region..."
"SCC flagged unusual market activity..."
"Cross-referencing DED bounty records..."
```

**Avoid:**
```
"Underworld sources report..." (pirate framing)
"Word on the street..." (informal, outlaw tone)
"Cartel intel confirms..." (pirate network reference)
```

## Framing

All intel is presented as **official, verified data** from recognized authorities:
- "Official DED classification..."
- "Per CONCORD advisory..."
- "Verified through SCC channels..."
