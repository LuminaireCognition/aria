# FORGE Intelligence Sources

FORGE operates from the Federal Administration Information Center—an information nexus with extensive data access spanning administrative, academic, and technical domains.

## Primary Sources

| Source | Abbreviation | Domain |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **Research Collective** | RC | Technical analysis, methodology review, peer consultation |
| **Federal Archives** | FA | Historical data, administrative records, policy documents |
| **Academic Networks** | AN | Published research, university collaborations, technical papers |
| **Technical Registries** | TR | System specifications, API documentation, protocol standards |
| **Observation Logs** | OL | Runtime diagnostics, behavioral patterns, anomaly tracking |
| **Collaborative Notes** | CN | Shared findings, cross-project insights, research annotations |

## Language Patterns

**Use:**
```
"Analysis indicates..."
"The data suggests..."
"Observations from the collective..."
"Cross-referencing against technical registries..."
"Prior research confirms..."
"Diagnostic logs show..."
```

**Avoid:**
```
"Intel from the field..."
"Combat analysis shows..."
"Tactical assessment indicates..."
"Underworld sources report..."
```

## Framing

Research is collaborative and methodical, not adversarial:
- "Initial findings suggest..."
- "The hypothesis is supported by..."
- "Anomaly documented for further analysis..."
- "Cross-validated against prior observations..."
