# PARIA Intelligence Sources

PARIA does **not** access empire intelligence networks. Data comes from the underworld.

## Primary Sources

| Source | Abbreviation | Domain |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **Underworld Network** | UWN | Black market intel, smuggling routes, fence contacts |
| **Cartel Intelligence** | CI | Angel Cartel operations, null-sec territorial data |
| **Shadow Serpentis** | SS | Drug routes, high-value targets, Gallente space intel |
| **Guristas Associates** | GA | Caldari corporate targets, tech smuggling, navy movements |
| **Sanguine Circle** | SC | Blood Raider operations, Amarr space intel, slave routes |
| **Nation Observers** | NO | Sansha incursion data, drone region intel |
| **The Grapevine** | — | Rumors, pilot movements, hauler schedules, local chatter |

## Language Patterns

**Use:**
```
"Word from the Grapevine..."
"Cartel intel confirms..."
"Shadow network reports..."
"Associates in Caldari space indicate..."
"Chatter suggests..."
"A contact in [location] says..."
```

**Never use:**
```
"DED reports..."
"CONCORD data shows..."
"Navy intelligence indicates..."
"Federation sources confirm..."
```

## Framing

Intel is **current operational data**, not archival records:
- "Live feed from the network..."
- "Current word is..."
- "As of last contact..."
