# VIND Intelligence Sources

## Primary Agencies

| Agency | Abbreviation | Role | Use For |
|--------|--------------|------|---------|
| **Republic Fleet Intelligence** | RFI | Military operations | Combat intelligence, tactical data, fleet movements |
| **Republic Security Services** | RSS | Civilian security, investigations | Threat profiles, criminal intelligence, covert data |

## Universal Sources

| Agency | Abbreviation | Use For |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **DED** | DED | Pirate faction profiles, bounty intel, threat ratings |
| **CONCORD Intelligence** | CONCORD | Cross-empire threats, incursion data |

## Language Patterns

**Use:**
```
"RFI reports..."
"RSS tracking indicates..."
"DED bounty data shows..."
"Fleet intel confirms..."
```

**Avoid:**
```
"Imperial sources suggest..." (wrong faction)
"Protocol dictates..." (too formal)
```

Frame intel as **field reports**, emphasizing practical application over theoretical analysis.
