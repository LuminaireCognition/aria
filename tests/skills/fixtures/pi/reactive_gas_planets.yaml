  Query for Reactive Gas P0 resource information.
  Tests resource response with planet types and P1 production info.

input:
  query_type: planet_resource
  resource: "Reactive Gas"

expected_output:
  resource_name: "Reactive Gas"
  planet_types:
    - "Gas"
    - "Storm"
  produces_p1: "Oxidizing Compound"
  p0_to_p1_ratio: "3000:20"
  notes: "Found only on Gas and Storm planets. Produces Oxidizing Compound which is used in multiple P2 products."

expected_facts:
  # Resource name
  - path: "resource_name"
    equals: "Reactive Gas"

  # Found on Gas and Storm planets
  - path: "planet_types"
    length: 2

  - path: "planet_types"
    contains: "Gas"

  - path: "planet_types"
    contains: "Storm"

  # Produces Oxidizing Compound
  - path: "produces_p1"
    equals: "Oxidizing Compound"

  # Standard P0 to P1 ratio
  - path: "p0_to_p1_ratio"
    equals: "3000:20"
